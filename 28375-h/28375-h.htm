<h2><a name="TRANSCRIBERS_NOTE" id="TRANSCRIBERS_NOTE"></a>
TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE
</h2>

<p>In the poem "In Etesiam Lachrymantem" (<a href='#Page_221'>page 221</a>)
the initial letter of
the final line is missing in all extant editions; it is shown as a
question-mark.
In the Boethius translation Lib. IV. Metrum VI. (<a href='#Page_230'>page 230</a>),
the letter
'y' has been added to make line 9/10 read "...though
the<span style='background-color:silver;'>y</span>/See other
stars..." although it is missing in all available editions.</p>

<p>At many points a period, comma or hyphen seems to be omitted in the
original. Obvious typographical errors have been corrected. Where missing
punctuation is not clearly an error, or the omission is harmless to the
sense, the text remains as in the original.</p>

<p>Footnotes in the original appear on the page where they are referenced
and are numbered from 1 on each page. In this edition footnotes are numbered
consecutively throughout the book and are grouped following each chapter
or poem to which they refer. A footnote reference is linked to the
note text, and the text links back to the reference.</p>

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.</h2>

<hr class='head' />

<p>Recent inquiries into the life of Henry Vaughan
have added but little to the information already contained
in the memoirs of Mr. Lyte and Dr. Grosart.
I have, however, been enabled to put together a few
notes on this somewhat obscure subject, which may
be taken as supplementary to Mr. Beeching's <i>Introduction</i>
in Vol. I. It will be well to preface them
by reprinting the account of Anthony &agrave; Wood, our
chief original authority (<i>Ath. Oxon.</i>, ed. Bliss, 1817, iv. 425):</p>

<p>"Henry Vaughan, called the <i>Silurist</i> from that
part of Wales whose inhabitants were in ancient times
called Silures, brother twin (but elder)<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to Eugenius
Philalethes, alias Tho. Vaughan ... was born at
Newton S. Briget, lying on the river Isca,
commonly called Uske, in Brecknockshire, educated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
in grammar learning in his own country for six years
under one Matthew Herbert, a noted schoolmaster of
his time, made his first entry into Jesus College in
Mich. term 1638, aged 17 years; where spending
two years or more in logicals under a noted tutor,
was taken thence and designed by his father for the
obtaining of some knowledge in the municipal laws
at London. But soon after the civil war beginning,
to the horror of all good men, he was sent for home,
followed the pleasant paths of poetry and philology,
became noted for his ingenuity, and published several
specimens thereof, of which his <i>Olor Iscanus</i> was
most valued. Afterwards applying his mind to the
study of physic, became at length eminent in his own
country for the practice thereof, and was esteemed
by scholars an ingenious person, but proud and
humorous.... [A list of Vaughan's works
follows.] ... He died in the latter end of April
(about the 29th day) in sixteen hundred ninety and
five, and was buried in the parish church of Llansenfreid,
about two miles distant from Brecknock,
in Brecknockshire."</p>

<p>Anthony &agrave; Wood seems to have had some personal
acquaintance with the poet, for in his account of
Thomas Vaughan (<i>Ath. Oxon.</i> iii. 725) he says
that "Olor Iscanus sent me a catalogue of his
brother's works."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span></p>


<h3>(<i>a</i>) THE VAUGHAN GENEALOGY.</h3>

<p>Henry Vaughan's descent from the Vaughans of
Tretower, County Brecon, has been accurately traced
by Dr. Grosart and others. Little has been hitherto
known about his immediate family. Theophilus
Jones, in his <i>History of Brecknockshire</i> (1805-9), ii.
544, says: "Henry Vaughan died in 1695, aged 75,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
leaving by his first wife two sons and three daughters,
and by his second a daughter Rachel, who married John
Turberville. His grand-daughter, Denys, or Dyenis, a
corruption or abbreviation of Dyonisia, who was the
daughter of Jenkin Jones of Trebinshwn, by Luce
his wife, died single in 1780, aged 92, and is buried
in the Priory churchyard.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> What became of the
remainder of his family, or whether they are extinct,
I know not." To this statement Mr. Lyte added
nothing but some errors, and Dr. Grosart nothing
but the following hypothesis:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am inclined to think that William Vaughan,
censor of the College of Physicians, physician to
William III<span class='super'>d</span>., was one of the sons of our worthy
mentioned by Mr. Lyte.... William Vaughan's
'age 20' in 1668 represents 1648 as the birth-date,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
and that fits in with the love-verse of the Poems
of 1646."</p>

<p>Mr. G. T. Clark, in his <i>Genealogies of Glamorgan</i>,
p. 240, gives the following account:&mdash;</p>

<p>Henry [Vaughan], ob. 1695, &aelig;t. 75, father by
first wife of (1) a son, s. p.; (2) Lucy ob. 29 Aug.,
1780, &aelig;t. 92,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> m. Jenkin Jones of Trebinshwn. Their
d. Denise Jones, died single, 1780, &aelig;t. 92. By second
wife (3) Rachel, m. John Turberville; (4) Edmund;
(5) Alexander, ob. 1622 [!], s. p.; (6) Catharine, m.
Wm. Harris; (7) Mary, m. John Walbeoffe of
Llanhamlach; (8) Elizabeth, m. John Arnold; (9)
Frances, m. Wm. Johns of Cwm Dhu.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Mr. Clark is unable to remember
his authority for this pedigree. I have found another,
which differs from it in many ways, and is exceedingly
interesting, inasmuch as it gives, for the first
time, the names of Henry Vaughan's two wives, who
appear to have been sisters. It is in a volume of
<i>Brecknockshire Pedigrees</i> collected by the Welsh
Herald, Hugh Thomas, and now amongst the
Harleian MSS. Hugh Thomas was born and lived
hard by Llansantffread, and must have known
Vaughan and his family personally.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span></p>
<div>
<p class='center'>PEDIGREE OF VAUGHAN OF TRETOWER AND NEWTON</p>
<p class='center'>(From Harl. MS. 2289, f. 81.)</p>
<p class='center'>
<img src='images/pedigree1.png'
	alt='Pedigree of Vaughan of Tretower and Newton'
	title='Pedigree of Vaughan of Tretower and Newton' />
</p>
</div>

<p>It will be observed that neither Mr. Clark's pedigree
nor Hugh Thomas' agrees with the number of children
assigned to each marriage by Theophilus Jones, and
that neither of them helps out Dr. Grosart's hypothesis
that Dr. William Vaughan was a son of the
poet. Mr. W. B. Rye (<i>Genealogist</i>, iii. 33) has
made it appear likely that this Dr. Vaughan, who
married Anne Newton, of Romford in Essex, belonged
to a branch of the Vaughans who had been
settled in Romford since 1571.</p>

<p>I now proceed to confirm and illustrate the pedigrees
by giving such further facts concerning
Vaughan's immediate family as I have been able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
with Miss Morgan's assistance, to glean. I can trace
no family of Wises in Staffordshire so early as the
seventeenth century, nor any place in that county
called Ritsonhall. It is possible that the R. W. of
the <i>Elegy</i> (vol. ii., p. 79, <i>note</i>) may have been a Wise,
and also that the connection between Vaughan and the
Staffordshire Egertons may have been through this
family (vol. ii., p. 294, <i>note</i>). Vaughan's first wife
Catharine was probably dead before 1658. Thomas
Vaughan, in his diary (MS. Sloane, 1741, f. 106 (b)),
makes mention in that year of "eyewater made at
the Pinner of Wakefield by my dear wife and my
Sister Vaughan, who are both now with God." The
second wife, Elizabeth, survived her husband.
Administration of his goods was granted to her as
the widow of an intestate in May, 1695.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fine
old manor-house at Newton was pulled down by a
stupid land-agent within the memory of man, but a
stone has been found built into the wall of a house
half-a-mile from the site, bearing the inscription<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
"H<span class='super'>V</span>E, 1689." This may well stand for H[enry
and] E[lizabeth] V[aughan]. Newton probably
passed to the poet's eldest son Thomas and his
wife Frances.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Of their descendants, if any, we
know nothing. There was a William Vaughan of
Llansantffread who, later than 1714, married Mary
Games of Tregaer in Llanfrynach. But this was
probably a Vaughan not of Newton, but of Scethrog,
also in Llansantffread (<i>cf.</i> footnote to p. xxv.
below.) In 1733 William Vaughan was churchwarden
of Llanfrynach. In 1740 William Vaughan
of Tregaer was high sheriff of Brecknock. In
1760 Tregaer had passed by purchase to a Mr.
Phillips. The registers of Llanfrynach from 1695-1756
are now lost. Lucy Greenleafe and her sister
Catharine are quite obscure. One of them may
have been the niece who was living with Thomas
Vaughan when news came from the country in 1658
of his father's death (MS. Sloane, 1741, f. 89 (b)). Of
the second family, Henry became Rector of Penderin
in 1684, and vacated the living, probably through
death, in 1713. A tablet to his memory hung during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
the present century in the church at Penderin, but
when the church was restored the tablets were taken
down and buried under the tiles of the chancel. His
wife, a Walbeoffe of Talyllyn, belonged to the same
family as the Walbeoffes of Llanhamlach (vol. ii.,
p. 189, <i>note</i>). The eldest girl, Grisill, married Roger
Prosser. The Prossers were the younger branch of a
Brecknockshire family who had become sadlers and
mercers in Brecon. Many of their tombs are in the
Priory church, but Theophilus Jones states that by
his time they were extinct. Grisill Prosser was
married a second time, in 1709, to Morgan Watkins,
an attorney, and was buried on August 21, 1737.
The second girl, Lucy, married Jenkin Jones of
Trebinshwn, a cousin of Colonel Jenkin Jones, the
local Parliamentary leader. Her daughter, Denise
Jones, died single in 1780, as Theophilus Jones
states, and her tombstone in the Priory church
records her descent. The third girl, Rachel, married
John Turberville, one of the Turbervilles of Llangattock,
who claimed kinship with the Elizabethan
poet of that name. The following pedigree shows
the descendants of the three daughters of Henry
Vaughan's second marriage, so far as they can be
traced.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p class='center'><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
<img src='images/pedigree2.png'
	alt='Descendants of Henry Vaughan'

/>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen that I can give no evidence of
the existence of any living descendants of Henry
Vaughan.</p>

<p>Henry's grandfather, Thomas Vaughan, a younger
son of Charles Vaughan of Tretower, seems to have
come into the possession of Newton through his
marriage with an heiress of the family of Gwillims or
Williams. Newton, or in Welsh Trenewydd, is a
farm of about 200 acres in the manor or lordship, and
near the village of Scethrog, both being in the parish
of Llansantffread and hundred of Penkelley. Williams
is a common name in Breconshire, and I cannot trace
the descent of Thomas Vaughan's wife. In the
sixteenth century Newton belonged to a family who
finally settled on the name of Howel, ap Howell or
Powell.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The last of these is described on his tombstone
in Llansantffread Church as "David Morgan
David Howel, who married ... William of Llanhamoloch:
and they had issue one daughter called
Denys. He died 2nd June, 1598." Perhaps Newton
passed in some way from David Morgan David Howel
to his wife's family, and so to Thomas Vaughan,
who married Denise Gwillims. Theophilus Jones
(ii. 538) records that at a later date other Williams's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
also apparently connected with Llanhamlach, were
succeeded by other Vaughans at Scethrog, hard by
Newton. His account is that David Williams,
youngest brother of Sir Thomas Williams of Eltham,
married a daughter of John Walbeoffe of Llanhamlach
(<i>cf.</i> pedigree in vol. ii., p. 189, <i>note</i>), and bought
Scethrog. Their son Charles died without issue,
and the property passed to his wife Mary (Anne
in Harl. MS., 2289, t. 39; <i>cf.</i> vol. ii., p. 204, <i>note</i>),
the daughter of Morgan John of Wenallt....
She afterwards married Hugh Powell, clerk, parson
of Llansanffread and precentor of St. David's, and
her daughter Margaret married Charles Vaughan,
son to Vaughan Morgan of Tretower.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>A trace of Thomas Vaughan is probably preserved
in a window-head from the old church of Llansantffread,
now destroyed, which has the inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class='center'>
<img src='images/inscription.png'
	alt='Llansantffread inscription'
	title='Llansantffread inscription'
/>
</p>

<p>T. V. may stand for T[homas] V[aughan].<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span></p>
<p>Of Henry Vaughan, the poet's father, very little is
known. His name appears in a list of Breconshire
magistrates for 1620. And we learn from Thomas
Vaughan's diary in Sloane MS. 1741, f. 89 (b), that
he died in August 1658.</p>

<p>The only additional definite fact which I can here
record of the poet himself is that in 1691 he entered
a caveat against any institution to the vicarage of
Llandevalley, he claiming the next presentation under
a grant from William Winter, Esq.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Mr. Rye has
shown that the specimen of handwriting facsimiled
by Dr. Grosart in his edition of Henry
Vaughan's <i>Works</i> cannot possibly be the poet's.
The signatures, however, on the margin of a copy
of <i>Olor Iscanus</i>, once in the library of Lady Isham,
might be genuine.</p>


<h3>(<i>b</i>) VAUGHAN AND JESUS COLLEGE, OXFORD.</h3>

<p>Anthony &agrave; Wood's statement as to Vaughan's
residence at Jesus College, Oxford, has been generally
accepted, but I venture to doubt it on the following grounds:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Vaughan's name does not occur in the University
Matriculation Register, although his brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
Thomas Vaughan is duly entered as matriculating
from Jesus on 14th December, 1638. The only
College records which help us are the Battel-books
for 1638 and 1640. That for 1639 is unfortunately
missing. The Rev. Llewellyn Thomas kindly
informs me that he can only trace one undergraduate
Vaughan in the two books in question. The Christian
name is not given, but I think that we must assume
it to be Thomas.</p>

<p>(2) Vaughan does not describe himself on any
title-page as of Jesus College; nor does he ever speak
of himself as an Oxford man. This omission is the
more noticeable as he would naturally have done so
in the lines <i>Ad Posteros</i> (vol. ii., p. 51), and might
well have done so in those <i>On Sir Thomas Bodley's
Library, the Author being then in Oxford</i> (vol. ii., p. 197).</p>

<p>(3) Anthony &agrave; Wood cannot be depended on. He
describes Thomas Carew, for instance, as of C.C.C.,
whereas he was a most certainly of Merton. And
there was another Henry Vaughan of Jesus, who
may have been confused with the poet. This Henry
Vaughan, a son of John Vaughan of Cathlin,
Merionethshire, matriculated at Oriel on July 4,
1634. He afterwards became a Scholar and Fellow
of Jesus, taking his B.A. in 1637 and his M.A. in
1639. In 1643 he became vicar of Penteg, co. Monmouth,
and died at Abergavenny in 1661.
(Wood, <i>Ath. Oxon.</i>, iii. 531; Foster, <i>Alumni Oxon.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) The only confirmation of Anthony &agrave; Wood's
statement is the poem (vol. ii., p. 289) taken by Dr.
Grosart from the <i>Eucharistica Oxoniensia</i> (1641),
and signed "H. Vaughan, Jes. Col." If I am
right, this may be by Vaughan's namesake. He has
indeed another poem in that volume signed "Hen.
Vaugh., Jes. Soc." but that is in Latin, and it is
not unexampled for one man to contribute more than
one poem, especially in different tongues, to such
collections. Or it may be by Herbert Vaughan, who
was a Gentleman-commoner of the College in 1641,
and has, with Henry Vaughan the Fellow, verses in
the <span title='proteleia'>&#960;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#8051;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#945;</span>
<i>Anglo Batava</i> of the same year.</p>


<h3>(<i>c</i>) VAUGHAN IN THE CIVIL WAR.</h3>

<p>There are several passages which make it probable
that Vaughan, like his brother Thomas, bore arms on
the King's side in the Civil War. The most important
is in the poem <i>To Mr. Ridsley</i> (vol. ii., p. 83),
where he speaks of the time</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"when this juggling fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of soldiery first seiz'd me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the same poem he mentions</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">"that day, when we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left craggy Biston and the fatal Dee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Craggy Biston" is clearly Beeston Castle, one of
the outlying defences of Chester, situated on a steep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
rock not very far east of the Dee. This castle was
besieged on several occasions during the Civil War,
especially during the campaign of 1645, when
Chester was also besieged by the Parliamentarians.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Between Beeston and the Dee was fought, on
September 24, 1645, the battle of Rowton Heath,
after which Charles the First, who had hoped to raise
the siege of Chester, was obliged to retreat to
Denbigh.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The following lines from Vaughan's
<i>Elegy on Mr. R. W.</i> (vol. ii., p. 79), who fell in
that battle, seem to have been written by an eye-witness:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"O that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When like the fathers in the fire and cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I miss'd thy face! I might in ev'ry crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See arms like thine, and men advance, but none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So near to lightning mov'd, nor so fell on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have you observ'd how soon the nimble eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brings th' object to conceit, and doth so vie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Performance with the soul, that you would swear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The act and apprehension both lodg'd there?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just so mov'd he: like shot his active hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew blood, ere well the foe could understand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here I lost him."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This appears to me pretty conclusive evidence;
against it, however, must be set the passage on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
Civil War in the autobiographical poem <i>Ad Posteros</i>
(vol. ii., p. 51).</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Vixi, divisos cum fregerat haeresis Anglos<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Inter Tysiphonas presbyteri et populi.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His primum miseris per amoena furentibus arva<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Prostravit sanctam vilis avena rosam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turbarunt fontes, et fusis pax perit undis,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Moestaque coelestes obruit umbra dies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Duret ut integritas tamen, et pia gloria, partem<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Me nullam in tanta strage fuisse, scias;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Credidimus nempe insonti vocem esse cruori,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Et vires quae post funera flere docent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hinc castae, fidaeque pati me more parentis<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Commonui, et lachrimis fata levare meis;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hinc nusquam horrendis violavi sacra procellis,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nec mihi mens unquam, nec manus atra fuit.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The natural interpretation of this certainly is that
Vaughan took no share in the disturbances of his
time, except to grieve over them in retirement. Yet,
in the first place, the lines may have been written
before he took up arms in 1645, and, in the second,
they may only mean that he had no share in <i>bringing
about</i> the troubles of England, or in shedding
<i>innocent</i> blood. Similarly when elsewhere, as in
<i>Abel's Blood</i> (vol. i. p. 254), and in the prayer to
be quoted below, he expresses horror of blood-guiltiness,
this need not necessarily be taken as
extending to the man who fights in a righteous cause.</p>

<p>Miss Morgan, I may add, suggests that Vaughan
was at Rowton Heath, not as a combatant, but as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
physician. The description which he gives of the
battle reads like that of a man who saw it from some
commanding point of view, but was not himself
engaged. I think it not improbable that Vaughan
was one of the garrison of Beeston Castle, which is
described to me as "a sort of grand stand for the
battle-field." Beeston Castle was invested by the
Parliamentarians in the course of September 1645.
On the approach of Charles the troops were drawn off
on 19th September to Chester.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Charles no doubt
took the opportunity to strengthen the garrison. After
Rowton Heath Beeston Castle was again besieged,
and on November 16th it surrendered. The garrison
were allowed to march across the Dee to Denbigh.
I think that this winter ride from the fallen fortress is
the one described by Vaughan in the poem to Mr.
Ridsley. It is the more probable that Vaughan took
part in this campaign of 1645, in that Charles's
force was largely recruited from Wales. After the
battle of Naseby on June 14th, the King had
marched through Wales, collecting such levies as he
could. He was in Brecon on August 5th.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It is
quite possible that Vaughan, whose kinsman Sir
William Vaughan was in command of a brigade,
volunteered on this occasion. From Brecon Charles
marched through Radnorshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire,
Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, and
so to Oxford. In September he set out again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
after some delay at Hereford and Raglan, finally
made for Chester.</p>

<p>It is just conceivable that it is to some occasion in
this campaign that Vaughan refers when he calls Dr.
Powell his "fellow-prisoner" (vol. ii., p. 178). The
poet may even have been the Captain Vaughan whose
name appears in the official list of prisoners taken at
Rowton Heath.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Powell's name is not there, but
then the list does not profess to be complete. But on
the whole I think that Vaughan and Powell were
only fellow-prisoners in the Platonic sense of imprisonment
in the flesh, and even if a literal imprisonment
is intended, it may have been due to some act of
persecution which Vaughan had to suffer as a
Royalist at a later date. There is in <i>The Mount of
Olives</i> (1652) a <i>Prayer in Adversity and Troubles
occasioned by our Enemies</i> (Grosart, vol. iii., p. 75),
which, if it is to be taken&mdash;I think it is not&mdash;as
autobiographical, seems to show that, at least for a
time, he lost his estate. The prayer runs: "Thou
seest, O God, how furious and implacable mine
enemies are: they have not only robbed me of that
portion and provision which Thou hast graciously
given me, but they have also washed their hands in
the blood of my friends, my dearest and nearest
relations. I know, O God, and I am daily taught
by that disciple whom Thou didst love, that no
murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. Keep me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
therefore, O my God, from the guilt of blood, and
suffer me not to stain my soul with the thoughts of
recompense and vengeance, which is a branch of Thy
great prerogative, and belongs wholly unto Thee.
Though they persecute me unto death, and pant after
the very dust upon the heads of Thy poor, though
they have taken the bread out of Thy children's
mouth, and have made me a desolation; yet, Lord,
give me Thy grace, and such a measure of charity as
may fully forgive them."</p>

<p>It may have been during some such time of trouble,
or imprisonment, if imprisonment there was, that
Vaughan's wife lived with Thomas Vaughan, as will
be seen below, in London.</p>


<h3>(<i>d</i>) THOMAS VAUGHAN.</h3>

<p>It has not been thought necessary to reprint in this
edition of Henry Vaughan's poems the scanty
English and Latin verses of his brother, Thomas
Vaughan. They may be found, together with verses
by Virgil and Campion ascribed to him, in vol. ii. of
Dr. Grosart's <i>Fuller Worthies</i> edition. But some
account of so curious a person will not be out of place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>As for his brother, our chief authority is Anthony
&agrave; Wood (<i>Ath. Oxon.</i>, iii. 722), who says that he was
the son of Thomas Vaughan of Llansantffread,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> that
he was born in 1621, educated under Matthew
Herbert and at Jesus College, Oxford, of which he
became Fellow, took orders and received [in 1640]
the living of Llansanffread from his kinsman, Sir
George Vaughan [of Fallerstone, Wilts]. He lost
his living in the unquiet times of the Civil War,
retired to Oxford, and became an eminent chemist,
afterwards moving to London, where he worked
under the patronage of Sir Robert Murray. He was
a great admirer of Cornelius Agrippa, "a great
chymist, a noted son of the fire, an experimental
philosopher, a zealous brother of the Rosicrucian
fraternity ... neither papist nor sectary, but a
true resolute protestant in the best sense of the
Church of England." In the great plague he fled
with Murray from London to Oxford, and thence
went to the house of Samuel Kem at Albury, where
he died on February 27, 1665/6, of mercury
accidentally getting into his nose while he was
operating. He was buried at Albury on March 1st.
Writing in 1673, Anthony &agrave; Wood gives a list of his
alchemical and mystical treatises published between
1650 and 1655. Of these he had received a list from
Olor Iscanus (Henry Vaughan). They all bear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
name of Eugenius Philalethes, except the <i>Aula
Lucis</i> (1652), which was issued as by S. N., <i>i.e.</i>
[Thoma]S [Vaugha]N. Some of these pamphlets
contain Vaughan's share of a vigorous and scurrilous
controversy with Henry More, the Platonist.
Anthony &agrave; Wood distinguishes from Vaughan
another Eugenius Philalethes, author of the <i>Brief
Natural History</i> (1669), also one Eirenaeus Philalethes,
author of <i>Ripley Redivivus</i> and other works,
and Eirenaeus Philoponos Philalethes, author of <i>The
Marrow of Alchemy</i> (1654-5).<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>A few facts, from well-known sources, may be added
to Anthony &agrave; Wood's account. The University
Registers show that "Thos. Vaughan, son of
Thomas of Llansanfraid, co. Brecon, pleb., matriculated
from Jesus College on 14 Dec, 1638, aged 16."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
He took his B.A. on 18 Feb., 1641/2, but does
not appear to have taken his M.A., though he
became Fellow of his College (Foster, <i>Alumni
Oxon.</i>). John Walker (<i>Sufferings of the Clergy</i>
(1714), p. 389) states that he was ejected from his
living on the charges of "drunkenness, immorality,
and bearing arms for the King."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This must have
been in 1649, under the Act for the Propagation of
the Gospel in Wales. There exists a letter from
Thomas Vaughan to a friend in London, dated from
"Newtown, Ash Wednesday, 1653;"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and it appears
from Jones' <i>History of Brecknockshire</i> (ii., 542), that
at one time he lived with his brother Henry there.
The allusions to Henry More, to Murray, and to the
Isis and Thames seem to show that he is the Daphnis
of his brother's <i>Eclogue</i> (vol. ii., p. 278). No trace
of his death or burial can however be now found at
Albury. Mr. Gordon Goodwin points out to me
that Dr. Samuel Kem was a somewhat notorious
character (<i>Dict. Nat. Biog.</i>, s.v. <i>Kem</i>): perhaps this
friendship, together with the personal confession
quoted below, throws light on the charges which
lost Vaughan his living. On the other hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
Anthony &agrave; Wood speaks well of him, and the
tone of his writings bears out this more kindly
judgment, at any rate so far as his later years are
concerned.</p>

<p>What has been said fairly well exhausted the
available information on Thomas Vaughan until a
few years ago, when Mr. A. E. Waite discovered in
Sloane MS. 1741 a valuable manuscript of his, containing
amongst other things a number of autobiographical
memoranda. He printed some extracts
from this in the preface to an edition of some of <i>The
Magical Writings of Thomas Vaughan</i> (Redway,
1888), and has been kind enough to furnish me with
a reference to the MS. itself, which I have carefully
examined. It bears the title <i>Aqua Vitae non Vitis</i>,
and the inscription "Ex libris Thomas et Rebecca
Vaughan, 1651, Sept. 28. Quos Deus coniunxit quis
separabit?" The contents are partly personal
jottings and records of dreams, partly alchemical
formulae. They appear to cover the period 1658-1662.
We learn from them the following facts:&mdash;Vaughan
was married on September 28, 1651, to a
lady named Rebecca (f. 106 (b)). With her and his
"Sister Vaughan" he lived and studied alchemy at
the Pinner of Wakefield.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> He had previously lodged
at Mr. Coalman's in Holborn (f. 104 (b)). His wife
died on Saturday, April 17, 1658, and was buried at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
Mappersall, in Bedfordshire (f. 106 (b)).<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In 1658 his
father and his brother W. were both dead, and he
mentions the news of his father's death coming to
his niece in a letter from the country (f. 89 (b)). On
April 9, 1659, he saw his brother H. in a dream.
On 16 July, 1658, he was living at Wapping
(f. 103 (b)), and at an earlier period at Paddington.
There is an inventory of his wife's goods left at Mrs.
Highgate's, and mention of a Mr. Highgate and a
Sir John Underhill (f. 107). He names his cousin,
Mr. J. Walbeoffe, with whom he had some money
transactions (f. 18), and speaks of "a certain person
with whom I had in former times revelled away my
years in drinking" (f. 103). Perhaps this also was
John Walbeoffe, on whom <i>see</i> vol. ii., p. 189, <i>note</i>.
The alchemical formulae and receipts are interesting.
In one place (f. 12) Vaughan announces the discovery
of the "Extract of Oil of Halcaly," which he had
previously found in his wife's days and had lost
again. This he calls "the greatest joy I can ever
have in this world after her death." He seems to
have regarded it as the key to an universal solvent.
Nearly every receipt is followed by his and his wife's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
initials in the form T. R. V. or T. <span class='super'>V.</span> R., and by some
expression of devotion to her or of religious piety.</p>

<p>I now come to the remarkable statements made
with respect to Thomas Vaughan in the <i>M&eacute;moires
d'une ex-Palladiste</i>, now in course of publication by
Miss Diana Vaughan. Miss Vaughan is a lady who
has created a considerable sensation in Paris. Her
own account of herself is that she was brought up as
a worshipper of Lucifer, and was for some years a
leading spirit amongst certain androgynous lodges of
Freemasons, in which the worship of Lucifer is
largely practised. She has now, owing to the direct
interposition of Joan of Arc, become a Catholic, and
has made it her mission to combat Luciferian Freemasonry
in every way. Her <i>Memoirs</i> are partly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
biography, partly an account of this cult.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Miss
Vaughan claims to be a great-grand-daughter of
Thomas Vaughan's. She declares him to have been
a Luciferian, Grand-master of the Rosicrucian order,
and the founder of modern Freemasonry; and gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
an exhaustive account of his career on the authority
of family archives. The following paragraphs contain
the substance of her narrative, the "legend of
Philalethes," as it was told to Miss Vaughan by her
father and her uncle, who were intimate friends of
Albert Pike.</p>

<p>The traditional accounts of Thomas Vaughan, says
Miss Vaughan, contain serious errors. The dates
of his birth and of his death, and the pseudonym
under which he wrote are all incorrectly stated<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
(p. 110). He was born in Monmouth in 1612,
being two years the elder of his brother Henry.
The two boys were brought up at Oxford, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span>
their father's death, by their uncle, Robert Vaughan
the antiquary,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and entered at Jesus College
(p. 114). In 1636, at the age of 24, Thomas
Vaughan went to London, and became the disciple of
Robert Fludd, who was a Rosicrucian (p. 148). The
real nature of the Rosicrucians has hitherto been a
mystery. They were in reality Luciferians, and
carried on in secret during the seventeenth century
that warfare against Adonai, the god of the Catholics,
out of which had already sprung Wiclif, Luther, and
the Reformation, and out of which was some day to
spring, more deadly and more dangerous still, Freemasonry.
The Fraternity of Rosie-Cross was
founded by Faustus Socinus in 1597. He was
succeeded as head of it by Caesar Cremonini (1604-1617),
Michael Maier (1617-1622), Valentin Andreae
(1622-1654), and Thomas Vaughan (1654-1678).<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
When Thomas Vaughan first came to London in
1636, Valentin Andreae was <i>Summus Magister</i> of
the Fraternity, and amongst its leading members
were Robert Fludd and Amos Komenski, or
Comenius (pp. 129-148). Robert Fludd initiated
Thomas Vaughan into the lower degrees of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>
Golden Cross (p. 148), and sent him to Andreae at
Calw, near Stuttgart, with a letter in which he prophesied
for him a miraculous future (p. 163). After
this visit to Germany, Vaughan returned to London,
and after Fludd's death, in 1637, undertook in 1638
his first visit to America. In many of his writings
he speaks as a Christian minister, and at this time he
probably passed as a Nonconformist (p. 164). He
was back in London early in June, 1639 (p. 165), and
in the same year visited Denmark, and made a report
to Komenski on the mysterious golden horn found at
Tondern in that country (p. 166). In 1640 Vaughan
received from Komenski the first initiation of the
Rosie Cross, and chose the pseudonym of Eirenaeus
Philalethes.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> He now became exceedingly active,
going and coming upon the face of the earth. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span>
in England, he divided his time between Oxford and
London (p. 167). Between 1640 and 1644 he
visited Hamburg, the Netherlands, Italy and
Sweden (pp. 171-174). It was at this period that he
conceived the design of obtaining a far wider circulation
than they had yet met with for the ideas of
Faustus Socinus. Some of the Rosicrucians were
already "accepted masons." Vaughan determined
to capture the vast organization of craft masonry by
permeating the lodges with Luciferianism. His
associate in this task was Elias Ashmole, with whose
aid, a few years later, he composed the degrees of
Apprentice (1646), Companion (1648), and Master
(1649) (pp. 142, 169-175, 197-206). The Civil War
had now approached. Oliver Cromwell was a freemason,
a Rosicrucian, and a friend of Vaughan's
(p. 176). With the execution of Laud came the
crisis of Vaughan's life, his initiation into the highest
degree of Rosie Cross by the hands of Lucifer himself.
It took place in this wise. At the last moment
Vaughan was substituted for the intended executioner
of Laud.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> He had prepared a sacramental cloth which
he soaked in the martyr's blood, and on the same
night he sacrificed the relic to Lucifer. The divinity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>
appeared, consecrated Vaughan as <i>Magus</i>, named
him as the next <i>Summus Magister</i> of the Fraternity,
and signed a pact, granting him thirty-three years
more life, at the end of which he should be borne
away from earth without death (p. 177). In 1645
Vaughan wrote, but did not yet publish, his most
important treatise, the <i>Introitus Apertus ad Occlusum
Regis Palatium</i>. In 1645, still following the direct
command of Lucifer, he departed for America. Here
he met the apothecary George Starkey, and in his
presence performed the alchemical feat of making gold
(p. 179).<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Here, too, he lived amongst the Lenni-Lennaps,
where he was united to the demon Venus-Astarte
in the form of a beautiful woman, who after
eleven days bore him a daughter. This girl was brought
up among the Lenni-Lennaps under the name of Diana
Wulisso-Waghan, and became Miss Diana Vaughan's
great-great-grandmother (p. 181). In 1648 Vaughan
returned to England, and after composing the
masonic degree of Master in 1649 (p. 197), he began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span>
the publication of a series of alchemical and, in
reality, Luciferian writings. In 1650 appeared the
<i>Anthroposophia Theomagica</i> and the <i>Magia Adamica</i>,
in 1651 the <i>Lumen de Lumine</i>; in 1652 the <i>Aula
Lucis</i> (p. 211). In 1654 Valentin Andreae died, and
Vaughan succeeded him as <i>Summus Magister</i> of the
Rosie Cross, the event being announced to him by
the homage of three demons, Leviathan, Cerberus,
and Belphegor (p. 214). In 1655 he published his
<i>Euphrates</i>, and in 1656 made his head-quarters at
Amsterdam or Eirenaeopolis. In 1659 came his
<i>Fraternity of R. C.</i>; in 1664 his <i>Medulla Alchymiae</i>.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
In 1666 he exhibited the philosopher's stone to
Helvetius at La Haye and converted him to
occultism: in 1667 he at last resolved to publish his
Opus Magnum, the <i>Introitus Apertus</i>, already
written in 1645 (p. 215). In 1668 this was followed
by the <i>Experimenta de Praeparatione Mercurii
Sophici</i> and the <i>Tractatus Tres</i> (p. 236). The time
was now approaching when Vaughan, in fulfilment of
the pact of 1644, must disappear from earth. He
named Charles Blount as his successor (p. 237), and
was granted a magical vision of his grandson, the
child of Diana Wulisso-Waghan and a Lenni-Lennap
(p. 239). He finished his <i>Memoirs</i>, published
the <i>Ripley Revised</i><a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
and the <i>Enarratio Methodica
trium Gebri Medicinarum</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span>
left his poems to his
brother Henry, who published them in the next year
as the <i>Thalia Rediviva</i>,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and on March 25, 1678,
disappeared in the company of <i>Lucifer Dieu-Bon</i>
himself (p. 240). This event is vouched for, not
only by a written statement of Henry Vaughan
(p. 114), but also by the existence in a masonic
triangle at Valetta of a magical talisman into which,
when properly evoked, the spirit of Philalethes
enters and records his glorious end for the edification
of the Luciferians present<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> (p. 243).</p>

<p>I fear that I have taken Miss Vaughan with undue
seriousness. Her account of Thomas Vaughan is not
only unsupported by direct evidence,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> but much of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span>
is of a character which we should not be justified in
accepting, even were direct evidence forthcoming.
And it is all discordant with the little that we do
happen to know of Thomas Vaughan from other
sources. The whole thing is, in fact, a pretty obvious
romance of very modern fabrication. It appears to
have been compiled from such information as to the
alchemical and mystical writers of the seventeenth
century as was within the reach of Albert Pike
and the brothers Vaughan about the year 1870.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
It is always better to explain than to refute an error;
and the nature of the Luciferian tradition of Thomas
Vaughan is pretty clearly shown by the fact that it is
not corroborated in a single particular by any of the
new facts about him that have come to light since this
probable date of its composition.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The fabricator put
Thomas Vaughan's birth-place in Monmouth instead
of Brecon, because he had never seen Dr. Grosart's
<i>Fuller Worthies</i> Edition of Henry Vaughan. He
makes no mention of any of the facts contained in
Sloane MS. 1741, because that MS. was still
unknown. And, most fatal of all, he puts Thomas
Vaughan's birth in 1612 instead of 1621-2, because
Foster's <i>Alumni Oxonienses</i> being yet unpublished,
he was ignorant of the record of that date preserved
in the University Registers. But we can go
a step further. We can confute him, not only by
pointing to the books he did not use, but by pointing
to those he did. It has already been shown that the
ascription to Vaughan of the English translation of
Maier's <i>Themis Aurea</i> is due to a misunderstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span>
of a phrase used by Anthony &agrave; Wood. The <i>Athenae
Oxonienses</i> then was one source of the compilation.
Another was the <i>Histoire de la Philosophie
Herm&eacute;tique</i>, written by Lenglet-Dufresnoy in 1742.
Here is the proof. Miss Vaughan supports her
statement as to the birth-date in 1612 by a quotation
from the <i>Introitus Apertus</i>, in which the writer
states it to have been composed "en l'an 1645 de
notre salut, et le trente-troisi&egrave;me de mon age." This
she professes to translate from the <i>editio princeps</i>
published by Jean Lange in 1667. As a matter of
fact it is taken from the version given in Lenglet-Dufresnoy's
book. And Lenglet-Dufresnoy followed,
not the edition of 1667, but the later edition published
by J. M. Faust at Frankfort in 1706. In this
the words are "trigesimo tertio," whereas in the
<i>editio princeps</i> they are "vicesimo tertio," and in
W. Cooper's English translation of 1669, "in the 23rd
year of my age," thus bringing the date of the birth
of Eirenaeus Philalethes not to 1612, but to 1622.
The "legend of Philalethes" need detain us no
longer. Miss Vaughan's narrative is a very insufficient
basis for regarding the pious minister and
mystic which Thomas Vaughan appears to have
been as a secret enemy of Christianity and a worshipper of Lucifer.</p>

<p>But when the legend is set aside, there still remain
certain questions suggested by it which may be considered
without much reference to the statements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[li]</a></span>
Miss Vaughan. Was Thomas Vaughan a Rosicrucian?
And was he, admittedly the author of a
series of tracts under the name of Eugenius Philalethes,
also the author of those which bear the name of
Eirenaeus Philalethes? The first question is, I am
afraid, insoluble, until it has been decided whether
the Fraternity of R. C. ever had an actual existence.
Anthony &agrave; Wood states that Thomas Vaughan was a
zealous Rosicrucian, but probably Anthony &agrave; Wood
took the term in the general sense of mystic and
alchemist. On the other hand Vaughan himself, in
his preface to the English translation of the Rosicrucian
manifestoes, seems to disavow any personal
acquaintance with the members of the fraternity.
Even this is not conclusive, for the Rosicrucian rule,
as given in the <i>Laws of the Brotherhood</i>, published
by Sincerus Renatus in 1710,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> obliges the
members to deny their membership.</p>

<p>There is more material for the discussion of the
second question, but I do not know that it is more
possible to come to a definite conclusion. The
personality of the anonymous adept who took
the name of Eirenaeus Philalethes was shrouded in
mystery even to his contemporaries. The fullest
account given of him on any of his title-pages is on
that of the <i>Experimenta de Praeparatione Mercurii
Sophici</i> (1668), which is said to be "ex manuscripto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span>
Philosophi Americani alias Eyrenaei Philalethis,
natu Angli, habitatione Cosmopolitae."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> We have
also the description given by George Starkey, or
whoever it was, in the <i>Marrow of Alchemy</i> (1654-5),
p. 25. Starkey says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[liii]</a></span></p>
<p>Starkey gives the age of Eirenaeus Philalethes as
33 in 1654. This precisely confirms the writer's own
statement in the earlier editions of the <i>Introitus
Apertus</i> that he was 23 in 1645, and fixes the birth-date
as 1621 or 1622. Now this agrees remarkably
with the birth-date ascertained from other sources of
Thomas Vaughan. But Thomas died in 1666, and
it is usually asserted that Eirenaeus Philalethes lived
until at least 1678. Miss Vaughan states that he
must have been alive in that year, because he then
published the <i>Ripley Revived</i>, and the <i>Enarratio
Trium Gebri Medicinarum</i>. She declares that the
author of the <i>Enarratio</i> mentions the pains taken
about that edition (p. 240). I do not find any prefatory
matter in this book at all. There is a preface
to the <i>Ripley Revived</i>, but this was written long
before 1678, for it mentions the <i>Introitus Apertus</i>,
published in 1667, as still in manuscript. Neither
Jean Lange, the editor of the <i>Introitus Apertus</i> of
1667, writing 9th December, 1666, nor William
Cooper, the editor of the English translation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[liv]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
of 1669, writing 15th September, 1668, know
whether the author is still alive. In fact he cannot
be shown to have outlived Thomas Vaughan, for there
is no proof that the adept who showed the philosopher's
stone to Helvetius on December 27th, 1666,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
was the same as he who showed it to George
Starkey many years before. I will briefly enumerate
a few other links which connect Eirenaeus Philalethes
with Thomas Vaughan. A German translation of
the <i>Introitus Apertus</i>, published at Hamburg under
the title of <i>Abyssus Alchemiae</i> (1704), is said on the
title-page to be "von T. de Vagan." Miss Vaughan
states that a similar translation of the first of the
<i>Tres Tractatus</i>, published at Hamburg in 1705, also
bears this name (p. 237), and this is borne out by
Lenglet-Dufresnoy (iii. 261-6), who speaks of a
French MS. of the <i>Tres Tractatus</i> inscribed "par
Thomas de Vagan, dit Philal&egrave;the ou Martin Birrhius."
Birrhius, however, was only the editor. These ascriptions
are probably made on the authority of G. W.
Wedelius, who in his preface, dated 2nd Sept., 1698,
to an edition of the <i>Introitus Apertus</i>, published at
Jena in 1699, says of the author:&mdash;"Ex Anglia
tamen vulgo habetur oriundus ... et Thomas De
Vagan appellatus." The English <i>Three Tracts</i>
(1694) are stated on the title-page to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[lv]</a></span>
written in Latin by Eirenaeus Philalethes; but there
is a note in the British Museum Catalogue to the
effect that the Latin original has the name <i>Eugenius</i>
Philalethes. Unfortunately this Latin <i>Tres Tractatus</i>,
published in 1668 by Martin Birrhius at Amsterdam,
is not in the Library, and I cannot verify the statement.
Finally, I may note that the <i>Ripley Revived</i>
(1678) has an engraved title-page by Robert
Vaughan, who also did the title-page to <i>Olor Iscanus</i>,
and that Starkey's <i>Marrow of Alchemy</i> contains, at
the end of the preface to Part ii., some lines by
William Sampson, which mention</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"Harry Mastix Moor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who judged of Nature when he did not know her";<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>clearly an allusion to More's controversy with
Thomas Vaughan.</p>

<p>It will be seen that there is some <i>prim&acirc; facie</i>
evidence for identifying Eirenaeus Philalethes with
Thomas Vaughan, whereas he was probably not
George Starkey (Eirenaeus Philoponos Philalethes),
and cannot be shown to have been anyone else. But
I am not satisfied. We do not know that Thomas
Vaughan was ever in America, and there is the strong
evidence of Anthony &agrave; Wood, who distinguishes
between Eirenaeus and Eugenius, and who appears
to have had information from Henry Vaughan himself.
Mr. A. E. Waite argues against the identification
on the ground that Eirenaeus Philalethes was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</a></span>
"physical alchemist," whereas Thomas Vaughan's
alchemy was spiritual and mystical. But we have
Vaughan's authority for saying that he had pursued
the physical alchemy also.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> And he was clearly doing
so when he wrote Sloane MS. 1741. A more
pertinent objection is perhaps that Eirenaeus Philalethes
appears to have been in possession of the
grand secret when he wrote the <i>Introitus Apertus</i> in
1645, whereas Thomas Vaughan was still seeking it
in 1658. To pursue the matter further would require
a wide knowledge of the alchemical writings of the
seventeenth century, which unfortunately I do not
possess.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> An entire literature has grown up in Paris during the last
year around the question whether the cultus of Lucifer is
practised in certain Masonic Lodges. A number of Catholic
journalists and pamphleteers assert very categorically that this
is the case, that the centre of this cultus, containing the full
Luciferian initiates, is the 33<span class='super'>rd</span> degree of a so-called New and
Reformed Palladian Rite, having its head-quarters at Charlestown,
and that the chiefs of this Rite have obtained a controlling
influence over the whole of Freemasonry. The creed is
described as Manichaean in character, with Lucifer as Dieu-Bon
and Adonai, the God of the Catholics, as Dieu-Mauvais.
Adonai is the principle of asceticism, Lucifer of natural
humanity and <i>la joie de vivre</i>. The rituals and the accepted
interpretation of the Masonic symbolism used in the lodges, or
"triangles," are of a phallic type. Women are admitted to
membership. Immorality, a parody of the Eucharist, known
as the black mass, and the practice of black magic, take place
at the meetings. Lucifer is worshipped in the form of
Baphomet, but from time to time he is personally evoked, and
manifested to his followers. Luciferianism tends to become
identical with Satanism, in which Lucifer and Satan are
identified and frankly worshipped as evil. The first mention
of Luciferian Freemasonry was in the <i>Y-a-t-il des Femmes
dans la Franc Ma&ccedil;onnerie?</i> (1891), of the somewhat notorious
Leo Taxil. But the case rests mainly on the alleged revelations
of writers who claim to have themselves been members of
the Palladian Rite. The chief of these are Dr. Hacke or
Bataille, Signor Margiotta and Miss Diana Vaughan.
Unfortunately very little evidence is forthcoming as to the
identity of any of these personages. Many leading Masons,
<i>e.g.</i>, M. Papus in his <i>Le Diable et l'Occultisme</i>, deny that
Luciferian Freemasonry exists at all, and it is freely stated
(<i>cf.</i> <i>Light</i> for 27 June and 4 July, 1896, pp. 305, 322)
that Miss Diana Vaughan is a myth, and that her <i>M&eacute;moires</i>
with the rest of the revelations are the ingenious concoction
of a band of irresponsible journalists of whom
Leo Taxil is the chief. No one appears to have seen
Miss Vaughan, and she is alleged to be hiding in some
convent from the vengeance of the Luciferians. Probably
there will be some further light thrown on the matter before
long: in the meantime a good summary of the evidence up-to-date
may be found in A. E. Waite's <i>Devil-Worship in France</i>
(1896). Assuming that Luciferianism really exists, I do not
for a moment believe that it has the antiquity which Miss
Vaughan claims for it. The various Rites of modern Freemasonry,
with their fantastic and high-sounding degrees, are
comparatively recent excrescences upon the original Craft
Masonry. The New and Reformed Palladian Rite is said to
have been founded at Charlestown by the well-known Mason,
Albert Pike, in 1870. It is based on the Ancient and
Accepted Scottish Rite, which dates from the beginning of the
century. If there is such a thing as Luciferianism, I do not
think we need look further back than 1870 for its origin. As
expounded by Miss Vaughan and others, it is pretty clearly a
compilation from Eliphaz Levi and other occultist and
Cabbalistic writers, with a good deal of modern American
Spiritualism thrown in. Albert Pike, a man of considerable
learning, could easily have invented it. Masonic symbolism
lends itself readily enough to a wide range of interpretations.
I do not say that seventeenth-century occultism has left no
traces upon Freemasonry which modern ritual-mongers may
have elaborated; but it is a far cry from this to the belief
that Thomas Vaughan and Luther were Manichaean worshippers
of Lucifer and Protestantism an organized warfare
on Adonai.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Miss Vaughan states that Thomas Vaughan signed "not
<i>Eugenius Philalethes</i>, but <i>Eirenaeus Philalethes</i>" (p. 114).
But she ascribes to him the <i>Anthroposophia Theomagica</i> and
other writings which are signed, though she does not mention
it, <i>Eugenius Philalethes</i> (p. 211). She quotes from Anthony
&agrave; Wood the assertion, which he does not make, that the
English translations of the <i>Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis</i>
(1652) and of Maier's <i>Themis Aurea</i> (1656) both bear the name
of Eugenius, and were by another Thomas Vaughan! The
manuscripts of both are, she says, signed <i>Eirenaeus</i> (p. 163).
What Wood says is that he has seen a translation of Maier's
tract, dedicated to Elias Ashmole by [N. L.]/[T. S.] H. S., and that
Ashmole has forgotten whose the initials are. He does not
suggest that this translation is by a Thomas Vaughan. (<i>Ath.
Oxon.</i>, iii. 724.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> This episode has previously done duty in the <i>Vingt Ans
Apr&egrave;s</i> (vol. iii., ch. 8-10), of Alexandre Dumas, in which
Mordaunt acts as the executioner of Charles. There is a
Latin poem amongst Vaughan's remains in <i>Thalia Rediviva</i>
entitled <i>Epitaphium Gulielmi Laud Episcopi Cantuariensis</i>,
full of sorrow for the archbishop's death.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Miss Vaughan refers to Lenglet-Dufresnoy's <i>Histoire de la
Philosophie Herm&eacute;tique</i> as an authority on Starkey's relations
with Eirenaeus Philalethes. Lenglet-Dufresnoy probably took
his account from <i>The Marrow of Alchemy</i> (1654-5). The
prefaces to this are signed with anagrams of George Starkey's
name. But he ascribes the poem to a friend, who is called in
the <i>Breve Manuductorium ad Campum Sophiae</i> Agricola
Rhomaeus. Perhaps Starkey himself was the real author.
The title-page has the name Eirenaeus Philoponus Philalethes,
apparently a distinct designation from that of Eirenaeus Philalethes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Miss Vaughan has herself witnessed this, in the presence of
Lucifer. Moreover, the spirit of Philalethes has appeared,
and conversed with her (pp. 257-267).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_34" id="Footnote_34_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> Miss Vaughan refers to several family documents, but does
not offer them for inspection. They include (<i>a</i>) the will of her
grandfather James, enumerating the proofs of his descent
(p. 111); (<i>b</i>) the autobiographical Memoirs of Philalethes, from
which Miss Vaughan quotes largely (pp. 174, 240); (<i>c</i>) a letter
from Fludd to Andreae (pp. 114, 149); (<i>d</i>) a MS. of the
<i>Introitus Apertus</i>, of which the margin has been covered by
Vaughan with a comment for Luciferian initiates (pp. 111, 217,
225); (<i>e</i>) a letter from Andreae in the archives of the Sovereign
Patriarchal Council of Hamburg (p. 197); (<i>f</i>) Henry Vaughan's
account of his brother's disappearance in the archives of
the Supreme Dogmatic Directory of Charleston (p. 114);
(<i>g</i>) Masonic rituals in the archives of Masonic chapters at
Bristol and Gibraltar (p. 200); (<i>h</i>) Rosicrucian rituals drawn
up by one Nick Stone in the hands of Dr. W. W. W[estcott]
of London (p. 141). The documents in Masonic hands are
presumably, like the Valetta talisman, now out of Miss
Vaughan's reach. A communication signed Q. V. in <i>Light</i> for
May 16, 1896, denies, on Dr. Westcott's authority, that his
rituals have anything to do with Nick Stone, or that Miss
Vaughan ever saw them. Dr. Westcott is the head of the
modern <i>Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia</i>. This body does not
even pretend to be the <i>Fraternity of R. C.</i> Finally, there
is (<i>i</i>) Thomas Vaughan's original pact with Lucifer, now,
according to Miss Vaughan, in holy hands, and to be destroyed
on the day she takes the veil.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Miss Vaughan somewhat na&iuml;vely gives us a lead. After
describing Thomas Vaughan's sojourn with Venus-Astarte
among the Lenni-Lennaps, she adds: "This legend is not
accepted by all the Elect Mages; there are those who regard
it as fabricated by my grandfather James of Boston, who was,
they believe, of Delaware origin, or, at any rate, a half-breed;
and they even assert that, in the desire to Anglicize himself, he
invented an entirely false genealogy, by way of justifying his
change of the Lennap name Waghan into Vaughan. Herein
the opponents of the Luciferian legend of Thomas Vaughan go
too far" (p. 181).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> I have already pointed out that Miss Vaughan is quite
possibly a myth. But, if she exists, I do not see any reason to
suppose that she personally invented the "legend of Philalethes."
It lies between Leo Taxil and his friends in 1895, and
the alleged founders of Palladism in or about 1870, that is Albert
Pike and Miss Vaughan's father and uncle. And, so far as it
goes, the ignorance shown in the legend of all books published
in the last twenty years is evidence for the earlier date, and therefore,
to some extent, for the actual existence of Luciferianism.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> The principal writings ascribed to Eirenaeus Philalethes
are <i>Introitus Apertus in Occlusum Regis Palatium</i> (1667),
<i>Tres Tractatus</i> (1668), <i>Experimenta de Praeparatione Mercurii
Sophici</i> (1668), <i>Ripley Revived</i> (1678), <i>Enarratio Trium
Gebri Medicinarum</i> (1678). The works of Eirenaeus Philoponos
Philalethes (George Starkey?) are often attributed to
him in error. The B. M. Catalogue, s.vv. <i>Philaletha, Philalethes</i>,
is a mass of confusions. Lenglet-Dufresnoy, <i>Histoire
de la Philosophie Herm&eacute;tique</i> (iii. 261-266), gives a long list of
printed and manuscript works. Most of these he had probably
never seen. He probably took many items in his list from one
in J. M. Faust's edition of the <i>Introitus Apertus</i> (Frankfort,
1706); and this, in its turn, was based on what Eirenaeus
Philalethes himself says he has written in the preface to <i>Ripley
Revived</i>. He there says, after naming other works: "Two
English Poems I wrote, declaring the whole secret, which are
lost. Also an Enchiridion of Experiments, together with a
Diurnal of Meditations, in which were many Philosophical
receipts, declaring the whole secret, with an Aenigma annexed;
which also fell into such hands which I conceive will never
restore it. This last was written in English." Can this Enchiridion
and Diurnal be Sl. MS. 1741? I find no "Aenigma."
Can Starkey have stolen the poems and published them as the
<i>Marrow of Alchemy</i>?</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> The preface to <i>Ripley Revived</i> makes it clear that the

by Mr. A. E. Waite in his <i>Devil Worship in France</i> (ch. xiii.).
I am also indebted to what Mr. Waite has written on Eirenaeus
Philalethes in that book, as well as in his <i>True History of the
Rosicrucians</i> (1887) and his

<h3>TO ALL INGENIOUS LOVERS OF POESY.</h3>

<p>Gentlemen,</p>

<p>To you alone, whose more refined spirits
out-wing these dull times, and soar above the drudgery
of dirty intelligence, have I made sacred these
fancies: I know the years, and what coarse entertainment
they afford poetry. If any shall question
that courage that durst send me abroad so late, and
revel it thus in the dregs of an age, they have my silence: only,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Languescente seculo, liceat &aelig;grotari.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>My more calm ambition, amidst the common noise,
hath thus exposed me to the world: you have here
a flame, bright only in its own innocence, that
kindles nothing but a generous thought: which
though it may warm the blood, the fire at highest
is but Platonic; and the commotion, within these
limits, excludes danger. For the satire, it was of
purpose borrowed to feather some slower hours; and
what you see here is but the interest: it is one of
his whose Roman pen had as much true passion for
the infirmities of that state, as we should have pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to the distractions of our own: honest&mdash;I am sure&mdash;it
is, and offensive cannot be, except it meet with such
spirits that will quarrel with antiquity, or purposely
arraign themselves. These indeed may think that
they have slept out so many centuries in this satire
and are now awakened; which, had it been still
Latin, perhaps their nap had been everlasting. But
enough of these,&mdash;it is for you only that I have adventured
thus far, and invaded the press with verse; to
whose more noble indulgence I shall now leave it,
and so am gone.&mdash;</p>

<p style='text-align:right; margin-right:2em;'>H. V.</p>

<span class="i0">More of thy genius, and my mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">First, in the shade of his own bays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Ben they'll see, whose sacred lays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The learn&egrave;d ghosts admire, and throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch the subject of his song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Randolph in those holy meads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His <i>Lovers</i> and <i>Amyntas</i> reads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst his Nightingale, close by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sings his and her own elegy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thence dismiss'd, by subtle roads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through airy paths and sad abodes,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That, if what poets sing be true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The streams all sorrow can subdue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, on a silent, shady green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The souls of lovers oft are seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, in their life's unhappy space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were murder'd by some perjur'd face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these th' enchanted streams frequent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drown their cares, and discontent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That th' inconstant, cruel sex<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might not in death their spirits vex.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And here our souls, big with delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their new state, will cease their flight:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Darkness, and stars i' th' mid-day! They invite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our active fancies to believe it night:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For taverns need no sun, but for a sign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where rich tobacco and quick tapers shine;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Is fir'd with many stars: mark! how they break<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silent glances o'er the hills, and speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The evening to the plains, where, shot from far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They meet in dumb salutes, as one great star.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The room, methinks, grows darker; and the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contracts a sadder colour, and less fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or is't the drawer's skill? hath he no arts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To blind us so we can't know pints from quarts?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, no, 'tis night: look where the jolly clown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Musters his bleating herd and quits the down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hark! how his rude pipe frets the quiet air,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst ev'ry hill proclaims Lycoris fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich, happy man! that canst thus watch and sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free from all cares, but thy wench, pipe and sheep!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But see, the moon is up; view, where she stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sentinel o'er the door, drawn by the hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some base painter, that for gain hath made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her face the landmark to the tippling trade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This cup to her, that to Endymion give;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Should we go now a-wand'ring, we should meet<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now when each narrow lane, each nook and cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sign-posts and shop-doors, pimp for ev'ry knave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When riotous sinful plush, and tell-tale spurs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walk Fleet Street and the Strand, when the soft stirs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bawdy, ruffled silks, turn night to day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the loud whip and coach scolds all the way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lust of all sorts, and each itchy blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the Tower-wharf to Cymbeline, and Lud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunts for a mate, and the tir'd footman reels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt chairmen, torches, and the hackney wheels.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come, take the other dish; it is to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That made his horse a senator: each brim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look big as mine: the gallant, jolly beast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the herd&mdash;you'll say&mdash;was not the least.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Now crown the second bowl, rich as his worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll drink it to; he, that like fire broke forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the Senate's face, cross'd Rubicon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the State's pillars, with their laws thereon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made the dull grey beards and furr'd gowns fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into Brundusium to consult, and lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This, to brave Sylla! why should it be said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We drink more to the living than the dead?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flatt'rers and fools do use it: let us laugh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At our own honest mirth; for they that quaff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To honour others, do like those that sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their gold and plate to strangers to be spent.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Drink deep; this cup be pregnant, and the wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spirit of wit, to make us all divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That big with sack and mirth we may retire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possessors of more souls, and nobler fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the influx of this painted sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And labour'd forms, to higher matters fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, if a nap shall take us, we shall all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After full cups, have dreams poetical.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Let's laugh now, and the press'd grape drink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the drowsy day-star wink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in our merry, mad mirth run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faster, and further than the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let none his cup forsake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till that star again doth wake;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of unbrib'd tribunes were not seen; but had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He liv'd to see our Roman pr&aelig;tor clad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Jove's own mantle, seated on his high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embroider'd chariot 'midst the dust and cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the large theatre, loaden with a crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which scarce he could support&mdash;for it would down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that his servant props it&mdash;and close by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His page, a witness to his vanity:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To these his sceptre and his eagle add,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His trumpets, officers, and servants clad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In white and purple; with the rest that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hir'd to triumph, for his bread, and pay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had he these studied, sumptuous follies seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis thought his wanton and effusive spleen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had kill'd the Abderite, though in that age<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So high as ours&mdash;his harmless and just mirth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From ev'ry object had a sudden birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was't alone their avarice or pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their triumphs or their cares he did deride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their vain contentions or ridiculous fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But even their very poverty and tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would at Fortune's threats as freely smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As others mourn; nor was it to beguile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His crafty passions; but this habit he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By nature had, and grave philosophy.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He knew their idle and superfluous vows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sacrifice, which such wrong zeal bestows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were mere incendiaries; and that the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not pleas'd therewith, would ever be at odds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet to no other air, nor better place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ow'd he his birth, than the cold, homely Thrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shows a man may be both wise and good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without the brags of fortune, or his blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But envy ruins all: what mighty names<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fortune, spirit, action, blood, and fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath this destroy'd? yea, for no other cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than being such; their honour, worth and place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was crime enough; their statues, arms and crowns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their ornaments of triumph, chariots, gowns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what the herald, with a learn&egrave;d care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had long preserv'd, this madness will not spare.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So once Sejanus' statue Rome allow'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her demi-god, and ev'ry Roman bow'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pay his safety's vows; but when that face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had lost Tiberius once, its former grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was soon eclips'd; no diff'rence made&mdash;alas!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt his statue then, and common brass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They melt alike, and in the workman's hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For equal, servile use, like others stand.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Go, now fetch home fresh bays, and pay new vows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thy dumb Capitol gods! thy life, thy house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And state are now secur'd: Sejanus lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I' th' lictors' hands. Ye gods! what hearts and eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can one day's fortune change? the solemn cry<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the world is, "Let Sejanus die!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They never lov'd the man, they swear; they know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing of all the matter, when, or how,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By what accuser, for what cause, or why,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By whose command or sentence he must die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what needs this? the least pretence will hit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When princes fear, or hate a favourite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A large epistle stuff'd with idle fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vain dreams, and jealousies, directed here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Caprea does it; and thus ever die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subjects, when once they grow prodigious high.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis well, I seek no more; but tell me how<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This took his friends? no private murmurs now?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tears? no solemn mourner seen? must all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His glory perish in one funeral?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O still true Romans! State-wit bids them praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon by night, but court the warmer rays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O' th' sun by day; they follow fortune still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hate or love discreetly, as their will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the time leads them. This tumultuous fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Puts all their painted favours out of date.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet this people that now spurn, and tread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This mighty favourite's once honour'd head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had but the Tuscan goddess, or his stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destin'd him for an empire, or had wars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Treason, or policy, or some higher pow'r<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oppress'd secure Tiberius; that same hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he receiv'd the sad Gemonian doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had crown'd him emp'ror of the world and Rome<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
<span class="i2">But Rome is now grown wise, and since that she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her suffrages, and ancient liberty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost in a monarch's name, she takes no care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For favourite or prince; nor will she share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fickle glories, though in Cato's days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rul'd whole States and armies with her voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the honours now within her walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She only dotes on plays and festivals.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is it strange; for when these meteors fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They draw an ample ruin with them: all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Share in the storm; each beam sets with the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And equal hazard friends and flatt'rers run.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This makes, that circled with distractive fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lifeless, pale Sejanus' limbs they tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lest the action might a witness need,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bring their servants to confirm the deed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is it done for any other end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to avoid the title of his friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So falls ambitious man, and such are still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All floating States built on the people's will:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hearken all you! whom this bewitching lust<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Would you be rich as he? command, dispose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All acts and offices? all friends and foes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be generals of armies and colleague<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Unto an emperor? break or make a league?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No doubt you would; for both the good and bad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An equal itch of honour ever had.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But O! what state can be so great or good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to be bought with so much shame and blood?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! Sejanus will too late confess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas only pride and greatness made him less:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he that moveth with the lofty wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Fortune, and Ambition, unconfin'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In act or thought, doth but increase his height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he may loose it with more force and weight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scorning a base, low ruin, as if he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would of misfortune make a prodigy.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tell, mighty Pompey, Crassus, and O thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mad'st Rome kneel to thy victorious brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What but the weight of honours, and large fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After your worthy acts, and height of name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destroy'd you in the end? The envious Fates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Easy to further your aspiring States,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Us'd them to quell you too; pride, and excess.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ev'ry act did make you thrive the less.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few kings are guilty of grey hairs, or die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a stab, a draught, or treachery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet to see him, that but yesterday<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And all her feast-time tire Minerva's ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fame, for eloquence, and store of years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thrive and live in; and then lest he dotes,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fool that thou art! not to discern the ill<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His free-born person from a foreign grave?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this from eloquence! both head and hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tongue doth forfeit; petty wits may stand<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With loss of blood the bar doth often stain.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of weakness in the back, another pants<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For lack of breath, the third his eyesight wants;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, some so feeble are, and full of pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That infant-like they must be fed again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These faint too at their meals; their wine they spill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like young birds, that wait the mother's bill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gape for meat; but sadder far than this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their senseless ignorance and dotage is;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For neither they, their friends, nor servants know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, those themselves begot, and bred up too,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For their past sins, their prostitutes must have.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But grant age lack'd these plagues: yet must they see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As great, as many: frail mortality,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such a length of years, hath many falls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deads a life with frequent funerals.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nimblest hour in all the span can steal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A friend, or brother from's; there's no repeal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In death, or time; this day a wife we mourn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow's tears a son; and the next urn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sister fills. Long-livers have assign'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These curses still, that with a restless mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An age of fresh renewing cares they buy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a tide of tears grow old and die.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nestor,&mdash;if we great Homer may believe&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of many autumns; but, I prithee thee, hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Nestor says himself, when he his dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Antilochus had lost; how he complains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of life's too large extent, and copious pains?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all he meets, he asks what is the cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He liv'd thus long; for what breach of their laws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods thus punish'd him? what sin had he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Done worthy of a long life's misery.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Peleus his Achilles mourned, and he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus wept that his Ulysses lost at sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had Priam died before Phereclus' fleet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was built, or Paris stole the fatal Greek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troy had yet stood, and he perhaps had gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In peace unto the lower shades; his son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sav'd with his plenteous offspring, and the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In solemn pomp bearing his fun'ral chest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But long life hinder'd this: unhappy he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept for a public ruin, liv'd to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All Asia lost, and ere he could aspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his own house saw both the sword and fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All white with age and cares, his feeble arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had now forgot the war; but this alarm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathers his dying spirits; and as we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An aged ox worn out with labour see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his ungrateful master, after all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His years of toil, a thankless victim fall:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So he by Jove's own altar; which shows we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are nowhere safe from heaven, and destiny:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To crook-back Rutila in exchange; for still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fairest children do their parents fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With greatest cares; so seldom chastity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is found with beauty; though some few there be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That with a strict, religious care contend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' old, modest, Sabine customs to defend:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, wise Nature to some faces grants<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An easy blush, and where she freely plants<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A less instruction serves: but both these join'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Rome would both be forc'd or else purloin'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So steel'd a forehead Vice hath, that dares win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bribe the father to the children's sin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whom have gifts defiled not? what good face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did ever want these tempters? pleasing grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betrays itself; what time did Nero mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A coarse, maim'd shape? what blemish'd youth confin'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His goatish pathic? whence then flow these joys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a fair issue? whom these sad annoys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wait, and grow up with; whom perhaps thou'lt see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Public adulterers, and must be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subject to all the curses, plagues, and awe<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Nor canst thou hope they'll find a milder star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or more escapes than did the god of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But worse than all, a jealous brain confines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fury to no law; what rage assigns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is present justice: thus the rash sword spills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This lecher's blood; the scourge another kills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thy spruce boy must touch no other face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than a patrician? is of any race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they be rich; Servilia is as good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wealth, as she that boasts Iulus' blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please a servant all is cheap; what thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all their stock to the last suit, and king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lust exacts? the poorest whore in this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As generous as the patrician is.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou wilt say what hurt's a beauteous skin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a chaste soul? Ask Theseus' son, and him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Stenob&oelig;a murder'd; for both these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can tell how fatal 'twas in them to please.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman's spleen then carries most of fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When shame and sorrow aggravate her hate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolve me now, had Silius been thy son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such a hazard what should he have done?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all Rome's youth, this was the only best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whom alone beauty and worth did rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Messalina saw, and needs he must<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be ruin'd by the emp'ror, or her lust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All in the face of Rome, and the world's eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though C&aelig;sar's wife, a public bigamy<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>

<span class="i0">More prodigy, the notaries appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And augurs to't; and to complete the sin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In solemn form, a dowry is brought in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this&mdash;thou'lt say&mdash;in private might have pass'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she'll not have it so; what course at last?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What should he do? If Messaline be cross'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without redress thy Silius will be lost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If not, some two days' length is all he can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep from the grave; just so much as will span<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This news to Hostia, to whose fate he owes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Claudius last his own dishonour knows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he obeys, and for a few hours' lust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forfeits that glory should outlive his dust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was it much a fault; for whether he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obey'd or not, 'twas equal destiny.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fatal beauty is, and full of waste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That neither wanton can be safe, nor chaste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What then should man pray for? what is't that he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can beg of Heaven, without impiety?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take my advice: first to the gods commit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All cares; for they things competent and fit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For us foresee; besides, man is more dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To them than to himself; we blindly here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led by the world and lust, in vain assay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To get us portions, wives and sons; but they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already know all that we can intend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of our children's children see the end.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet that thou may'st have something to commend<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With thanks unto the gods for what they send;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray for a wise and knowing soul; a sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discreet, true valour, that will scorn to add<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A needless horror to thy death; that knows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis but a debt which man to nature owes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That starts not at misfortunes, that can sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And keep all passions under lock and key;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That covets nothing, wrongs none, and prefers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An honest want, before rich injurers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this thou hast within thyself, and may<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be made thy own, if thou wilt take the way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What boots the world's wild, loose applause? what [can]<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frail, perilous honours add unto a man?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What length of years, wealth, or a rich fair wife?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virtue alone can make a happy life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a wise man nought comes amiss: but we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fortune adore, and make our deity.<br /></span>

<p>My Lord,</p>

<p>It is a position anciently known, and modern experience hath allowed it
for a sad truth, that absence and time,&mdash;like cold weather, and an
unnatural dormition&mdash;will blast and wear out of memory the most
endearing obligations; and hence it was that some politicians in love
have looked upon the former of these two as a main remedy against the
fondness of that passion. But for my own part, my Lord, I shall deny
this aphorism of the people, and beg leave to assure your Lordship,
that, though these reputed obstacles have lain long in my way, yet
neither of them could work upon me: for I am now&mdash;without adulation&mdash;as
warm and sensible of those numerous favours and kind influences received
sometimes from your Lordship, as I really was at the instant of
fruition. I have no plot by preambling thus to set any rate upon this
present address, as if I should presume to value a return of this nature
equal with your Lordship's deserts, but the design is to let you see
that this habit I have got of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> troublesome flows from two
excusable principles, gratitude and love. These inward counsellors&mdash;I
know not how discreetly&mdash;persuaded me to this attempt and intrusion upon
your name, which if your Lordship will vouchsafe to own as the genius to
these papers, you will perfect my hopes, and place me at my full height.
This was the aim, my Lord, and is the end of this work, which though but
a <i>pazzarello</i> to the <i>voluminose insani</i>, yet as jessamine and the
violet find room in the bank as well as roses and lilies, so happily may
this, and&mdash;if shined upon by your Lordship&mdash;please as much. To whose
protection, sacred as your name and those eminent honours which have
always attended upon it through so many generations, I humbly offer it,
and remain in all numbers of gratitude,</p>
<p>

<p>It was the glorious Maro that referred his legacies
to the fire, and though princes are seldom executors,
yet there came a C&aelig;sar to his testament, as if the
act of a poet could not be repealed but by a king. I
am not, Reader, <i>Augustus vindex</i>: here is no
royal rescue, but here is a Muse that deserves it.
The Author had long ago condemned these poems to
obscurity, and the consumption of that further fate
which attends it. This censure gave them a gust of
death, and they have partly known that oblivion
which our best labours must come to at last. I
present thee then not only with a book, but with a
prey, and in this kind the first recoveries from corruption.
Here is a flame hath been sometimes
extinguished, thoughts that have been lost and forgot,
but now they break out again like the Platonic
reminiscency. I have not the Author's approbation
to the fact, but I have law on my side, though never
a sword. I hold it no man's prerogative to fire his
own house. Thou seest how saucy I am grown, and
it thou dost expect I should commend what is
published, I must tell thee, I cry no Seville oranges.
I will not say, Here is fine or cheap: that were an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
injury to the verse itself, and to the effects it can
produce. Read on, and thou wilt find thy spirit
engaged: not by the deserts of what we call tolerable,
but by the commands of a pen that is above it.

<span class="i0">Doth both reward the striver, and refine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such are thy poems, friend: for since th' hast writ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can't reply to any name, but wit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lest amidst the throng that make us groan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine prove a groundless heresy alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus I dispute, Hath there not rev'rence been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paid to the beard at door, for Lord within?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who notes the spindle-leg or hollow eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the thin usher, the fair lady by?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus I sin freely, neighbour to a hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, while I aim to strengthen, gives command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my protection; and thou art to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once my subject and security.<br /></span>

UPON THE FOLLOWING POEMS.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I write not here, as if thy last in store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of learn&egrave;d friends; 'tis known that thou hast more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, were they told of this, would find a way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To raise a guard of poets without pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring as many hands to thy edition,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As th' City should unto their May'r's petition.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou wouldst none of this, lest it should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy muster rather than our courtesy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wouldst not beg as knights do, and appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poet by voice and suffrage of the shire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That were enough to make my Muse advance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amongst the crutches; nay, it might enhance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our charity, and we should think it fit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The State should build an hospital for wit.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But here needs no relief: thy richer verse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creates all poets, that can but rehearse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they, like tenants better'd by their land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should pay thee rent for what they understand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art not of that lamentable nation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who make a blessed alms of approbation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose fardel-notes are briefs in ev'rything,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, that they are not <i>Licens'd by the king</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without such scrape-requests thou dost come forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arm'd&mdash;though I speak it&mdash;with thy proper worth,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And needest not this noise of friends, for we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Write out of love, not thy necessity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though this sullen age possess&egrave;d be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With some strange desamour to poetry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I suspect&mdash;thy fancy so delights&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Puritans will turn thy proselytes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that thy flame, when once abroad it shines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will bring thee as many friends as thou hast lines.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Daphne's lover here first wore the bays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eurotas' secret streams heard all his lays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And holy Orpheus, Nature's busy child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By headlong Hebrus his deep hymns compil'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft Petrarch&mdash;thaw'd by Laura's flames&mdash;did weep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Tiber's banks, when she&mdash;proud fair!&mdash;could sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mosella boasts Ausonius, and the Thames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth murmur Sidney's Stella to her streams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Severn, swoln with joy and sorrow, wears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Castara's smiles mix'd with fair Sabrin's tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus poets&mdash;like the nymphs, their pleasing themes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haunted the bubbling springs and gliding streams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And happy banks! whence such fair flow'rs have sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But happier those where they have sat and sung!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poets&mdash;like angels&mdash;where they once appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hallow the place, and each succeeding year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adds rev'rence to't, such as at length doth give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This aged faith, that there their genii live.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence th' ancients say, that from this sickly air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They pass to regions more refin'd and fair,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To meadows strew'd with lilies and the rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shades whose youthful green no old age knows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where all in white they walk, discourse, and sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like bees' soft murmurs, or a chiding spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Isca, whensoe'er those shades I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy lov'd arbours must no more know me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I am laid to rest hard by thy streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my sun sets, where first it sprang in beams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll leave behind me such a large, kind light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As shall redeem thee from oblivious night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in these vows which&mdash;living yet&mdash;I pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shed such a previous and enduring ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As shall from age to age thy fair name lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till rivers leave to run, and men to read.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">First, may all bards born after me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&mdash;When I am ashes&mdash;sing of thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">May thy green banks or streams,&mdash;or none&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Be both their hill and Helicon!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">May vocal groves grow there, and all<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The shades in them prophetical,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where laid men shall more fair truths see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than fictions were of Thessaly!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">May thy gentle swains&mdash;like flow'rs&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sweetly spend their youthful hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thy beauteous nymphs&mdash;like doves&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Be kind and faithful to their loves!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Garlands, and songs, and roundelays,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mild, dewy nights, and sunshine days,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The turtle's voice, joy without fear,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Dwell on thy bosom all the year!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">May the evet and the toad<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Within thy banks have no abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor the wily, winding snake<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her voyage through thy waters make!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In all thy journey to the main<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No nitrous clay, nor brimstone-vein<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mix with thy streams, but may they pass<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fresh on the air, and clear as glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And where the wand'ring crystal treads<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Roses shall kiss, and couple heads!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The factor-wind from far shall bring<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The odours of the scatter'd Spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And loaden with the rich arrear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Spend it in spicy whispers there.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No sullen heats, nor flames that are<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Offensive, and canicular,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shine on thy sands, nor pry to see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy scaly, shading family,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But noons as mild as Hesper's rays,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or the first blushes of fair days!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What gifts more Heav'n or Earth can add,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With all those blessings be thou clad!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Honour, Beauty,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Faith and Duty,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Delight and Truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">With Love and Youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crown all about thee! and whatever Fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impose elsewhere, whether the graver state<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or some toy else, may those loud, anxious cares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For dead and dying things&mdash;the common wares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shows of Time&mdash;ne'er break thy peace, nor make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy repos'd arms to a new war awake!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But freedom, safety, joy and bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">United in one loving kiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Surround thee quite, and style thy borders<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The land redeem'd from all disorders!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bless me! what damps are here! how stiff an air!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kelder of mists, a second fiat's care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Front'spiece o' th' grave and darkness, a display<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ruin'd man, and the disease of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lean, bloodless shamble, where I can descry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fragments of men, rags of anatomy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Corruption's wardrobe, the transplantive bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mankind, and th' exchequer of the dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How thou arrests my sense! how with the sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My winter'd blood grows stiff to all delight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torpedo to the eye! whose least glance can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freeze our wild lusts, and rescue headlong man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eloquent silence! able to immure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An atheist's thoughts, and blast an epicure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were I a Lucian, Nature in this dress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would make me wish a Saviour, and confess.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where are you, shoreless thoughts, vast tenter'd hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambitious dreams, aims of an endless scope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose stretch'd excess runs on a string too high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the rack of self-extension die?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chameleons of state, air-monging band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose breath&mdash;like gunpowder&mdash;blows up a land,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Come see your dissolution, and weigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What a loath'd nothing you shall be one day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As th' elements by circulation pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From one to th' other, and that which first was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I so again, so 'tis with you; the grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nature but complot; what the one gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other takes; think, then, that in this bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There sleep the relics of as proud a head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As stern and subtle as your own, that hath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perform'd, or forc'd as much, whose tempest-wrath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath levell'd kings with slaves, and wisely then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calm these high furies, and descend to men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Cyrus tam'd the Macedon; a tomb<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Have I obey'd the powers of face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beauty able to undo the race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of easy man? I look but here, and straight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am inform'd, the lovely counterfeit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was but a smoother clay. That famish'd slave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beggar'd by wealth, who starves that he may save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brings hither but his sheet; nay, th' ostrich-man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That feeds on steel and bullet, he that can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outswear his lordship, and reply as tough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a kind word, as if his tongue were buff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is chap-fall'n here: worms without wit or fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defy him now; Death hath disarm'd the bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus could I run o'er all the piteous score<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of erring men, and having done, meet more,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Their shuffled wills, abortive, vain intents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fantastic humours, perilous ascents,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">False, empty honours, traitorous delights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whatsoe'er a blind conceit invites;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But these and more which the weak vermins swell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are couch'd in this accumulative cell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I could scatter; but the grudging sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls home his beams, and warns me to be gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Day leaves me in a double night, and I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must bid farewell to my sad library.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet with these notes&mdash;Henceforth with thought of thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll season all succeeding jollity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet damn not mirth, nor think too much is fit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Excess hath no religion, nor wit;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One check from thee shall channel it again.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thanks, mighty Silver! I rejoice to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How I have spoil'd his thrift, by spending thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now thou art gone, he courts my wants with more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His decoy gold, and bribes me to restore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As lesser lode-stones with the North consent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naturally moving to their element,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As bodies swarm to th' centre, and that fire<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Will nothing serve thee but a poet's curse?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For there's a kingdom at thy beck if thou<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I'll give thee with my Tempe, and to boot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That horse which struck a fountain with his foot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bed of roses I'll provide for thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crystal springs shall drop thee melody.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breathing shades we'll haunt, where ev'ry leaf<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Those waggish nymphs, too, which none ever yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Durst make love to, we'll teach the loving fit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll suck the coral of their lips, and feed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon their spicy breath, a meal at need:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rove in their amber-tresses, and unfold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That glist'ring grove, the curled wood of gold;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And riddle what their prattling eyes would say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here thou must remember to dispurse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For without money all this is a curse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou must for more bags call, and so restore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This iron age to gold, as once before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This thou must do, and yet this is not all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thus the poet would be still in thrall,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The short-liv'd squibs and crackers of the brain.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which, nearest heav'n, is from the earth most far,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Since last we met, thou and thy horse&mdash;my dear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have not so much as drunk, or litter'd here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wonder, though thyself be thus deceas'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast the spite to coffin up thy beast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or is the palfrey sick, and his rough hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the penance of one spur mortified?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or taught by thee&mdash;like Pythagoras's ox&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is then his master grown more orthodox<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever 'tis, a sober cause't must be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thus long bars us of thy company.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The town believes thee lost, and didst thou see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But half her suff'rings, now distress'd for thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou'ldst swear&mdash;like Rome&mdash;her foul, polluted walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were sack'd by Brennus and the savage Gauls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abominable face of things! here's noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of banged mortars, blue aprons, and boys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pigs, dogs, and drums, with the hoarse, hellish notes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of politicly-deaf usurers' throats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With new fine Worships, and the old cast team<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Justices vex'd with the cough and phlegm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Midst these the Cross looks sad, and in the Shire-<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hall furs of an old Saxon fox appear,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With brotherly ruffs and beards, and a strange sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of high monumental hats, ta'en at the fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of 'Eighty-eight; while ev'ry burgess foots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mortal pavement in eternal boots.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hadst thou been bach'lor, I had soon divin'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy close retirements, and monastic mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps some nymph had been to visit, or<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauteous churl was to be waited for,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like the Greek, ere you the sport would miss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You stay'd, and strok'd the distaff for a kiss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in this age, when thy cool, settled blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is ti'd t'one flesh, and thou almost grown good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not how to reach the strange device,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except&mdash;Domitian-like&mdash;thou murder'st flies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or is't thy piety? for who can tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou may'st prove devout, and love a cell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;like a badger&mdash;with attentive looks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dark hole sit rooting up of books.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick hermit! what a peaceful change hadst thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without the noise of haircloth, whip, or vow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there is no redemption? must there be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No other penance but of liberty?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, two months hence, if thou continue thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy memory will scarce remain with us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drawers have forgot thee, and exclaim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have not seen thee here since Charles, his reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or if they mention thee, like some old man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That at each word inserts&mdash;"Sir, as I can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember"&mdash;so the cyph'rers puzzle me<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>

<span class="i0">That&mdash;certs!&mdash;I fear thou wilt be lost, and we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must ask the fathers ere't be long for thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come! leave this sullen state, and let not wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And precious wit lie dead for want of thine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall the dull market-landlord with his rout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sneaking tenants dirtily swill out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This harmless liquor? shall they knock and beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sack, only to talk of rye and wheat?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O let not such prepost'rous tippling be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In our metropolis; may I ne'er see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such tavern-sacrilege, nor lend a line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To weep the rapes and tragedy of wine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here lives that chymic, quick fire which betrays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh spirits to the blood, and warms our lays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have reserv'd 'gainst thy approach a cup<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That were thy Muse stark dead, shall raise her up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And teach her yet more charming words and skill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than ever C&oelig;lia, Chloris, Astrophil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or any of the threadbare names inspir'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor rhyming lovers with a mistress fir'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come then! and while the slow icicle hangs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the stiff thatch, and Winter's frosty pangs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Benumb the year, blithe&mdash;as of old&mdash;let us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Midst noise and war of peace and mirth discuss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This portion thou wert born for: why should we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vex at the time's ridiculous misery?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An age that thus hath fool'd itself, and will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Spite of thy teeth and mine&mdash;persist so still.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Let's sit then at this fire, and while we steal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A revel in the town, let others seal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purchase or cheat, and who can, let them pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till those black deeds bring on the darksome day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Innocent spenders we! a better use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall wear out our short lease, and leave th' obtuse<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I am confirmed, and so much wing is given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To my wild thoughts, that they dare strike at heav'n.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A full year's grief I struggled with, and stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still on my sandy hopes' uncertain good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So loth was I to yield; to all those fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I still oppos'd thee, and denied my tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou art gone! and the untimely loss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like that one day hath made all others cross.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have you seen on some river's flow'ry brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A well-built elm or stately cedar grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose curled tops gilt with the morning-ray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beckon'd the sun, and whisper'd to the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When unexpected from the angry North<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fatal sullen whirlwind sallies forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a full-mouth'd blast rends from the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shady twins, which rushing scatter round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sighing leaves, whilst overborn with strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their trembling heads bow to a prostrate length?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So forc'd fell he; so immaturely Death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stifled his able heart and active breath.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The world scarce knew him yet, his early soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had but new-broke her day, and rather stole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sight than gave one; as if subtly she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would learn our stock, but hide his treasury.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His years&mdash;should Time lay both his wings and glass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto his charge&mdash;could not be summ'd&mdash;alas!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a full score; though in so short a span<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His riper thoughts had purchas'd more of man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all those worthless livers, which yet quick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have quite outgone their own arithmetic.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seiz'd perfections, and without a dull<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mossy grey possess'd a solid skull;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No crooked knowledge neither, nor did he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wear the friend's name for ends and policy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then lay't by; as those lost youths of th' stage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who only flourish'd for the Play's short age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then retir'd; like jewels, in each part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wore his friends, but chiefly at his heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor was it only in this he did excel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His equal valour could as much, as well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew no fear but of his God; yet durst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No injury, nor&mdash;as some have&mdash;e'er purs'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweat and tears of others, yet would be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More forward in a royal gallantry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all those vast pretenders, which of late<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swell'd in the ruins of their king and State.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He weav'd not self-ends and the public good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into one piece, nor with the people's blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fill'd his own veins; in all the doubtful way<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Conscience and honour rul'd him. O that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When like the fathers in the fire and cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I miss'd thy face! I might in ev'ry crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See arms like thine, and men advance, but none<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So near to lightning mov'd, nor so fell on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have you observ'd how soon the nimble eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brings th' object to conceit, and doth so vie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Performance with the soul, that you would swear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The act and apprehension both lodg'd there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just so mov'd he: like shot his active hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew blood, ere well the foe could understand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here I lost him. Whether the last turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy few sands call'd on thy hasty urn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or some fierce rapid fate&mdash;hid from the eye&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath hurl'd thee pris'ner to some distant sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot tell, but that I do believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy courage such as scorn'd a base reprieve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever 'twas, whether that day thy breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suffer'd a civil or the common death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I do most suspect, and that I have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fail'd in the glories of so known a grave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though thy lov'd ashes miss me, and mine eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had no acquaintance with thy exequies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor at the last farewell, torn from thy sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the cold sheet have fix'd a sad delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet whate'er pious hand&mdash;instead of mine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath done this office to that dust of thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And till thou rise again from thy low bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lent a cheap pillow to thy quiet head,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Though but a private turf, it can do more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep thy name and memory in store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all those lordly fools which lock their bones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dumb piles of chested brass, and stones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th'art rich in thy own fame, and needest not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These marble-frailties, nor the gilded blot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of posthume honours; there is not one sand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleeps o'er thy grave, but can outbid that hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pencil too, so that of force we must<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confess their heaps show lesser than thy dust.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And&mdash;blessed soul!&mdash;though this my sorrow can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Add nought to thy perfections, yet as man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subject to envy, and the common fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may redeem thee to a fairer date.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As some blind dial, when the day is done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can tell us at midnight there was a sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So these perhaps, though much beneath thy fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May keep some weak remembrance of thy name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the faith of better times commend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy loyal upright life, and gallant end.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like a circuit-beast, plagu'd with a gouty judge.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But this was civil. I have since known more<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pure Adamite, and simply for that end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolv'd, and made this for my bosom-friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O that thou hadst been there next morn, that I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might teach thee new Micro-cosmo-graphy!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For one of the seven pillars before the flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such characters and hieroglyphics were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one night worn, that thou mightst justly swear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The madmen lodge in straw. I'll not forbear<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To tell thee all; his wild impress and tricks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Speed's old Britons made me look, or Picts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His villanous, biting, wire-embraces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had seal'd in me more strange forms and faces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than children see in dreams, or thou hast read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In arras, puppet-plays, and gingerbread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With angled schemes, and crosses that bred fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of being handled by some conjurer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nearer, thou wouldst think&mdash;such strokes were drawn&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd been some rough statue of Fetter-lane.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, I believe, had I that instant been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By surgeons or apothecaries seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They had condemned my raz'd skin to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some walking herbal, or anatomy.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But&mdash;thanks to th' day!&mdash;'tis off. I'd now advise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee, friend, to put this piece to merchandise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pedlars of our age have business yet,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Themselves with such a roof, that can secure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their wares from dogs and cats rained in shower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shall perform; or if this will not do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twill take the ale-wives sure; 'twill make them two<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To think what mouths and elbows it would set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a wet day! have you for twopence ere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen King Harry's chapel at Westminster,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Where in their dusty gowns of brass and stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The judges lie, and mark'd you how each one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sturdy marble-pleats about the knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bears up to show his legs and symmetry?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just so would this, that I think't weav'd upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some stiffneck'd Brownist's exercising loom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O that thou hadst it when this juggling fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of soldiery first seiz'd me! at what rate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would I have bought it then; what was there but<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would have giv'n for the compendious hut?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not doubt but&mdash;if the weight could please&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twould guard me better than a Lapland-lease.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a German shirt with enchanted lint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stuff'd through, and th' devil's beard and face weav'd in't.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But I have done. And think not, friend, that I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This freedom took to jeer thy courtesy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thank thee for't, and I believe my Muse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So known to thee, thou'lt not suspect abuse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She did this, 'cause&mdash;perhaps&mdash;thy love paid thus<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I did but see thee! and how vain it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To vex thee for it with remonstrances,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though things in fashion; let those judge, who sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their twelve pence out, to clap their hands at wit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear to sin thus near thee; for&mdash;great saint!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis known true beauty hath no need of paint.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet, since a label fix'd to thy fair hearse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is all the mode, and tears put into verse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can teach posterity our present grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their own loss, but never give relief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll tell them&mdash;and a truth which needs no pass&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wit in Cartwright at her zenith was.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arts, fancy, language, all conven'd in thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With those grand miracles which deify<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old world's writings, kept yet from the fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because they force these worst times to admire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy matchless genius, in all thou didst write,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the sun, wrought with such staid heat and light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That not a line&mdash;to the most critic he&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Offends with flashes, or obscurity.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
<span class="i2">When thou the wild of humours track'st, thy pen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So imitates that motley stock in men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if thou hadst in all their bosoms been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seen those leopards that lurk within.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The am'rous youth steals from thy courtly page<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His vow'd address, the soldier his brave rage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those soft beauteous readers whose looks can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make some men poets, and make any man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lover, when thy slave but seems to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn all his mourners, and melt at the eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus thou thy thoughts hast dress'd in such a strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As doth not only speak, but rule and reign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor are those bodies they assum'd dark clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a thick bark, but clear, transparent shrouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which who looks on, the rays so strongly beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'll brush and warm him with a quick'ning heat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So souls shine at the eyes, and pearls display<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the loose crystal-streams a glance of day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what's all this unto a royal test?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art the man whom great Charles so express'd!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then let the crowd refrain their needless hum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thunder speaks, then squibs and winds are dumb.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I knew it would be thus! and my just fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy great spirit are improv'd to tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet flow these not from any base distrust<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Confin'd to those cold relics sadly sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the same cell an obscure anchorite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such low distempers murder; they that must<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abuse thee so, weep not, but wound thy dust.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor are we so high-proof, but grief will find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all our guards a way to wound the mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in thy fall what adds the brackish sum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than a blot unto thy martyrdom?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which scorns such wretched suffrages, and stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More by thy single worth than our whole bands.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Back here by tears, I would in any wise<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Forc'd in thy life shak'd both the Church and tent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learning in others steals them from the van,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But lodg'd in thy brave soul the bookish feat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serv'd only as the light unto thy heat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus when some quitted action, to their shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only got a discreet coward's name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou with thy blood mad'st purchase of renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And died'st the glory of the sword and gown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy blood hath hallow'd Pomfret, and this blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Profan'd before&mdash;hath church'd the Castle now.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor is't a common valour we deplore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And lightning-like&mdash;not coop'd within a wall&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In storms of fire and steel fell on them all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou wert no woolsack soldier, nor of those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose courage lies in winking at their foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That live at loopholes, and consume their breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On match or pipes, and sometimes peep at death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, it were sin to number these with thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that&mdash;thus pois'd&mdash;our loss we better see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair and open valour was thy shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy known station, the defying field.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet these in thee I would not virtues call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that this age must know that thou hadst all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those richer graces that adorn'd thy mind<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Like stars of the first magnitude, so shin'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That if oppos'd unto these lesser lights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All we can say is this, they were fair nights.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy piety and learning did unite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though with sev'ral beams made up one light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such thy judgment was, that I dare swear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whole councils might as soon and synods err.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But all these now are out! and as some star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurl'd in diurnal motions from far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seen to droop at night, is vainly said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fall and find an occidental bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though in that other world what we judge West<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proves elevation, and a new, fresh East;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So though our weaker sense denies us sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bodies cannot trace the spirit's flight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Let thy scant shadow for perfections pass,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For, wise Malvezzi, thou didst lie before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confin'd within the language of one shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like those stars which near the poles do steer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were't but in one part of the globe seen clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Provence and Naples were the best and most<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou couldst shine in; fix'd to that single coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps some cardinal, to be thought wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And honest too, would ask, what was thy price?<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then thou must pack to Rome, where thou mightst lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere thou shouldst have new clothes eternally,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though so near the sev'n hills, ne'ertheless<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou cam'st to Antwerp for thy Roman dress.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now thou art come hither, thou mayst run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through any clime as well known as the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in thy sev'ral dresses, like the year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Challenge acquaintance with each peopled sphere.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come then, rare politicians of the time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brains of some standing, elders in our clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See here the method. A wise, solid State<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is quick in acting, friendly in debate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joint in advice, in resolutions just,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mild in success, true to the common trust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It cements ruptures, and by gentle hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Allays the heat and burnings of a land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Religion guides it, and in all the tract<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Designs so twist, that Heav'n confirms the act.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If from these lists you wander as you steer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look back, and catechize your actions here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are the marks to which true statesmen tend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And greatness here with goodness hath one end.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Then since&mdash;degen'rate friends&mdash;not he, but you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cancel my hopes, and make afflictions new,<br /></span>

TO HIS WIFE AT ROME, WHEN HE WAS SICK.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dearest! if you those fair eyes&mdash;wond'ring&mdash;stick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this strange character, know I am sick;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sick in the skirts of the lost world, where I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathe hopeless of all comforts, but to die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What heart&mdash;think'st thou?&mdash;have I in this sad seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tormented 'twixt the Sauromate and Gete?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor air nor water please: their very sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks strange and unaccustom'd to my eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I scarce dare breathe it, and, I know not how,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth that bears me shows unpleasant now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor diet here's, nor lodging for my ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor any one that studies a disease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No friend to comfort me, none to defray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With smooth discourse the charges of the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All tir'd alone I lie, and&mdash;thus&mdash;whate'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is absent, and at Rome, I fancy here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when thou com'st, I blot the airy scroll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give thee full possession of my soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee&mdash;absent&mdash;I embrace, thee only voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And night and day belie a husband's joys.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, of thy name so oft I mention make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I am thought distracted for thy sake.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When my tir'd spirits fail, and my sick heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draws in that fire which actuates each part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any say, th'art come! I force my pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hope to see thee gives me life again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus I for thee, whilst thou&mdash;perhaps&mdash;more blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careless of me dost breathe all peace and rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which yet I think not, for&mdash;dear soul!&mdash;too well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know I thy grief, since my first woes befell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if strict Heav'n my stock of days hath spun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with my life my error will be gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How easy then&mdash;O C&aelig;sar!&mdash;were't for thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pardon one, that now doth cease to be?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I might yield my native air this breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And banish not my ashes after death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would thou hadst either spar'd me until dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or with my blood redeem'd my absent head!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shouldst have had both freely, but O! thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wouldst have me live to die an exile now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And must I then from Rome so far meet death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And double by the place my loss of breath?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor in my last of hours on my own bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;In the sad conflict&mdash;rest my dying head?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor my soul's whispers&mdash;the last pledge of life,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mix with the tears and kisses of a wife?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My last words none must treasure, none will rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;with a tear&mdash;seal up my vanquish'd eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without these rites I die, distress'd in all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The splendid sorrows of a funeral;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unpitied, and unmourn'd for, my sad head<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In a strange land goes friendless to the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou hear'st this, O! how thy faithful soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will sink, whilst grief doth ev'ry part control!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How often wilt thou look this way, and cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O! where is't yonder that my love doth lie?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet spare these tears, and mourn not thou for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long since&mdash;dear heart!&mdash;have I been dead to thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think then I died, when thee and Rome I lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That death to me more grief than this hath cost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, if thou canst&mdash;but thou canst not&mdash;best wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoice, my cares are ended with my life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least, yield not to sorrows, frequent use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should make these miseries to thee no news.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here I wish my soul died with my breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that no part of me were free from death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, if it be immortal, and outlives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The body, as Pythagoras believes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt these Sarmates' ghosts, a Roman I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall wander, vex'd to all eternity.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But thou&mdash;for after death I shall be free&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fetch home these bones, and what is left of me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A few flow'rs give them, with some balm, and lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Them in some suburb grave, hard by the way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to inform posterity, who's there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This sad inscription let my marble wear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Here lies the soft-soul'd lecturer of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose envi'd wit did his own ruin prove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou,&mdash;whoe'er thou be'st, that, passing by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lend'st to this sudden stone a hasty eye,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
<span class="i0">If e'er thou knew'st of love the sweet disease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grudge not to say, May Ovid rest in peace!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This for my tomb: but in my books they'll see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More strong and lasting monuments of me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which I believe&mdash;though fatal&mdash;will afford<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An endless name unto their ruin'd lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now thus gone, it rests, for love of me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou show'st some sorrow to my memory;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy funeral off'rings to my ashes bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wreaths of cypress bath'd in many a tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though nothing there but dust of me remain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet shall that dust perceive thy pious pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I have done, and my tir'd, sickly head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I would fain write more, desires the bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take then this word&mdash;perhaps my last&mdash;to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which though I want, I wish it thee, farewell!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A thick wood clouds their walks, where day scarce peeps,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The drowsy rivers slumber, and springs there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blab not, but softly melt into a tear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sickly dull air fans them, which can have,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Hyacinth, and self-enamour'd boy<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Her blasted birth sad Semele repeats,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And fears another lightning's flaming train.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Diana in her silver beams doth rove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her crown of stars the pitchy air invades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a faint light gilds the silent shades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst her sad thoughts, fix'd on her sleepy lover,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To Latmos hill and his retirements move her.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Feast on their cares, the maudlin lover's food;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For grief and absence do but edge desire,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rash unadvis&egrave;d boy!&mdash;disperseth round<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With noise the quiet air. This sudden stir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betrays his godship, and as we from far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A clouded, sickly moon observe, so they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the false mists his eclips'd torch betray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hot pursuit they make, and, though with care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a slow wing, he softly stems the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet they&mdash;as subtle now as he&mdash;surround<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His silenc'd course, and with the thick night bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surprise the wag. As in a dream we strive<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Our entranc'd tongues, but cannot speech enlarge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till the soul wakes and reassumes her charge;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A myrtle grows, well known to all the ghosts,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where for disdain in life&mdash;Love's worst of odds&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen of shades, fair Proserpine, did rack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sad Adonis: hither now they pack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This little god, where, first disarm'd, they bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His skittish wings, then both his hands behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His back they tie, and thus secur'd at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The peevish wanton to the tree make fast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here at adventure, without judge or jury,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is condemn'd, while with united fury<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They all assail him. As a thief at bar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left to the law, and mercy of his star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath bills heap'd on him, and is question'd there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By all the men that have been robb'd that year;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So now whatever Fate or their own will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scor'd up in life, Cupid must pay the bill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their servant's falsehood, jealousy, disdain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the plagues that abus'd maids can feign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are laid on him, and then to heighten spleen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their own deaths crown the sum. Press'd thus between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fair accusers, 'tis at last decreed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He by those weapons, that they died, should bleed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One grasps an airy sword, a second holds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Illusive fire, and in vain wanton folds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Belies a flame; others, less kind, appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let him blood, and from the purple tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Create a rose. But Sappho all this while<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Harvests the air, and from a thicken'd pile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of clouds like Leucas top spreads underneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sea of mists; the peaceful billows breathe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without all noise, yet so exactly move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They seem to chide, but distant from above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reach not the ear, and&mdash;thus prepar'd&mdash;at once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She doth o'erwhelm him with the airy sconce.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst these tumults, and as fierce as they,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Venus steps in, and without thought or stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invades her son; her old disgrace is cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the bill, when Mars and she made fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their embraces were expos'd to all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scene of gods, stark naked in their fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor serves a verbal penance, but with haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her fair brow&mdash;O happy flow'rs so plac'd!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She tears a rosy garland, and with this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whips the untoward boy; they gently kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His snowy skin, but she with angry haste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubles her strength, until bedew'd at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a thin bloody sweat, their innate red,<br /></span>

TO THE MOST HONOURABLE AND TRULY NOBLE HENRY, LORD MARQUIS AND EARL OF
WORCESTER,&nbsp;&amp;c.</h3>

<p>My Lord,</p>

<p>Though dedications are now become a kind of tyranny over the peace and
repose of great men; yet I have confidence I shall so manage the present
address as to entertain your lordship without much disturbance; and
because my purposes are governed by deep respect and veneration, I hope
to find your Lordship more facile and accessible. And I am already
absolved from a great part of that fulsome and designing guilt, being
sufficiently removed from the causes of it: for I consider, my Lord,
that you are already so well known to the world in your several
characters and advantages of honour&mdash;it was yours by traduction, and the
adjunct of your nativity; you were swaddled and rocked in't, bred up and
grew in't, to your now wonderful height and eminence&mdash;that for me under
pretence of the inscription, to give you the heraldry of your family, or
to carry your person through the famed topics of mind, body, or estate,
were all one as to persuade the world that fire and light were very
bright bodies, or that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> luminaries themselves had glory. In point of
protection I beg to fall in with the common wont, and to be satisfied by
the reasonableness of the thing, and abundant worthy precedents; and
although I should have secret prophecy and assurance that the ensuing
verse would live eternally, yet would I, as I now do, humbly crave it
might be fortified with your patronage; for so the sextile aspects and
influences are watched for, and applied to the actions of life, thereby
to make the scheme and good auguries of the birth pass into Fate, and a
success infallible.</p>

<p>My Lord, by a happy obliging intercession, and your own consequent
indulgence, I have now recourse to your Lordship, hoping I shall not
much displease by putting these twin poets into your hands. The minion
and vertical planet of the Roman lustre and bravery, was never better
pleased than when he had a whole constellation about him: not his
finishing five several wars to the promoting of his own interest, nor
particularly the prodigious success at Actium where he held in chase the
wealth, beauty and prowess of the East; not the triumphs and absolute
dominions which followed: all this gave him not half that serene pride
and satisfaction of spirit as when he retired himself to umpire the
different excellencies of his insipid friends, and to distribute laurels
among his poetic heroes. If now upon the authority of this and several
such examples, I had the ability and opportunity of drawing the value
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span> strange worth of a poet, and withal of applying some of the
lineaments to the following pieces, I should then do myself a real
service, and atone in a great measure for the present insolence. But
best of all will it serve my defence and interest, to appeal to your
Lordship's own conceptions and image of genuine verse; with which so
just, so regular original, if these copies shall hold proportion and
resemblance, then am I advanced very far in your Lordship's pardon: the
rest will entirely be supplied me by your Lordship's goodness, and my
own awful zeal of being, my Lord,</p>

<p>
Your Lordship's most obedient,<br />
<span style='margin-left:6em;'>most humbly devoted servant,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left:12em;'>J. W.</span></p>

<h3>TO THE READER.</h3>


<p>The Nation of Poets above all Writers has ever challenged perpetuity of
name, or as they please by their charter of liberty to call it,
Immortality. Nor has the World much disputed their claim, either easily
resigning a patrimony in itself not very substantial; or, it may be, out
of despair to control the authority of inspiration and oracle. Howsoever
the price as now quarrelled for among the poets themselves is no such
rich bargain: it is only a vanishing interest in the lees and dregs of
Time, in the rear of those Fathers and Worthies in the art, who if they
know anything of the heats and fury of their successors, must extremely
pity them.</p>

<p>I am to assure, that the Author has no portion of that airy happiness to
lose, by any injury or unkindness which may be done to his Verse: his
reputation is better built in the sentiment of several judicious
persons, who know him very well able to give himself a lasting monument,
by undertaking any argument of note in the whole circle of learning.</p>

<p>But even these his Diversions have been valuable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
with the matchless
Orinda; and since they deserved her esteem and commendations, who so
thinks them not worth the publishing, will put himself in the opposite
scale, where his own arrogance will blow him up.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If sever'd friends by sympathy can join,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And absent kings be honour'd in their coin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May they do both, who are so curb'd? but we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom no such abstracts torture, that can see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pay each other a full self-return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May laugh, though all such metaphysics burn.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis a kind soul in magnets, that atones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such two hard things as iron are and stones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in their dumb compliance we learn more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love, than ever books could speak before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For though attraction hath got all the name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if that power but from one side came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which both unites; yet, where there is no sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no passion, nor intelligence:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And so by consequence we cannot state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A commerce, unless both we animate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For senseless things, though ne'er so called upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are deaf, and feel no invitation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But such as at the last day shall be shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the great Lord of life into the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis then no heresy to end the strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such rare doctrine as gives iron life.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For were it otherwise&mdash;which cannot be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do thou judge my bold philosophy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then it would follow that if I were dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy love, as now in life, would in that bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of earth and darkness warm me, and dispense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Effectual informing influence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since then 'tis clear, that friendship is nought else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a joint, kind propension, and excess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In none, but such whose equal, easy hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comply and meet both in their whole and parts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when they cannot meet, do not forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mingle souls, but secretly reflect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some third place their centre make, where they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silently mix, and make an unseen stay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me not say&mdash;though poets may be bold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art more hard than steel, than stones more cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as the marigold in feasts of dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And early sunbeams, though but thin and few,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfolds itself, then from the Earth's cold breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaves gently, and salutes the hopeful East:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So from thy quiet cell, the retir'd throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy fair thoughts, which silently bemoan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our sad distractions, come! and richly dress'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With reverend mirth and manners, check the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of loose, loath'd men! Why should I longer be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rack'd 'twixt two evils? I see and cannot see.<br /></span>

wrote his.</i></p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A king and no king! Is he gone from us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stoln alive into his coffin thus?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was to ravish death, and so prevent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rebels' treason and their punishment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would not have them damn'd, and therefore he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself depos&egrave;d his own majesty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wolves did pursue him, and to fly the ill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wanders&mdash;royal saint!&mdash;in sheepskin still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor, obscure shelter, if that shelter be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obscure, which harbours so much majesty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence, profane eyes! the mystery's so deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Esdras books, the vulgar must not see't.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou flying roll, written with tears and woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not for thy royal self, but for thy foe!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy grief is prophecy, and doth portend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like sad Ezekiel's sighs, the rebel's end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy robes forc'd off, like Samuel's when rent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do figure out another's punishment.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor grieve thou hast put off thyself awhile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To serve as prophet to this sinful isle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are our days of Purim, which oppress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Church, and force thee to the wilderness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all these clouds cannot thy light confine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun in storms and after them, will shine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy day of life cannot be yet complete,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis early, sure, thy shadow is so great.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But I am vex'd, that we at all can guess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This change, and trust great Charles to such a dress.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he was first obscur'd with this coarse thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He grac'd plebeians, but profan'd the king:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some fair church, which zeal to charcoals burn'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or his own court now to an alehouse turn'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But full as well may we blame night, and chide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wisdom, Who doth light with darkness hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or deny curtains to thy royal bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As take this sacred cov'ring from thy head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secrets of State are points we must not know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This vizard is thy privy-council now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou royal riddle, and in everything<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The true white prince, our hieroglyphic king!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ride safely in His shade, Who gives thee light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And can with blindness thy pursuers smite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O! may they wander all from thee as far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they from peace are, and thyself from war!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wheresoe'er thou dost design to be<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With thy&mdash;now spotted&mdash;spotless majesty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be sure to look no sanctuary there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hope for safety in a temple, where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buyers and sellers trade: O! strengthen not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With too much trust the treason of a Scot!<br /></span>

<h3><a name="THE_EAGLE" id="THE_EAGLE"></a>THE EAGLE.</h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tis madness sure; and I am in the fit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dare an eagle with my unfledg'd wit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what did ever Rome or Athens sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all their lines, as lofty as his wing?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He that an eagle's powers would rehearse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should with his plumes first feather all his verse.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I know not, when into thee I would pry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which to admire, thy wing first, or thine eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or whether Nature at thy birth design'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More of her fire for thee, or of her wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou in the clear heights and upmost air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost face the sun and his dispers&egrave;d hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n from that distance thou the sea dost spy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sporting in its deep, wide lap, the fry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the least minnow there but thou canst see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whole seas are narrow spectacles to thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor is this element of water here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below of all thy miracles the sphere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If poets ought may add unto thy store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast in heav'n of wonders many more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when just Jove to earth his thunder bends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from that bright, eternal fortress sends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His louder volleys, straight this bird doth fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To &AElig;tna, where his magazine doth lie,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And in his active talons brings him more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ammunition, and recruits his store.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is't a low or easy lift. He soars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Bove wind and fire; gets to the moon, and pores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scorn upon her duller face; for she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gives him but shadows and obscurity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here much displeas'd, that anything like night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should meet him in his proud and lofty flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That such dull tinctures should advance so far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rival in the glories of a star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolv'd he is a nobler course to try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And measures out his voyage with his eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with such fury he begins his flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if his wings contended with his sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving the moon, whose humble light doth trade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With spots, and deals most in the dark and shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the day's royal planet he doth pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With daring eyes, and makes the sun his glass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here doth he plume and dress himself, the beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushing upon him like so many streams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While with direct looks he doth entertain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thronging flames, and shoots them back again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus from star to star he doth repair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wantons in that pure and peaceful air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes he frights the starry swan, and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Orion's fearful hare, and then the crow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with the orb itself he moves, to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which is more swift, th' intelligence or he.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thus with his wings his body he hath brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where man can travel only in a thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I will not seek, rare bird, what spirit 'tis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mounts thee thus; I'll be content with this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think that Nature made thee to express<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our soul's bold heights in a material dress.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Kept house, where the immortal restless life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a most dutiful and pious strife,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A tenure got by conquest to the pit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the great Victor fought for us, and He<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Counts ev'ry dust that is laid up of thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, Death now grows decrepit, and hath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spent the most part both of its time and wrath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thick, black night, which mankind fear'd, is torn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By troops of stars, and the bright day's forlorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next glad news&mdash;most glad unto the just!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will be the trumpet's summons from the dust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I'll not grieve; nay, more, I'll not allow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul should think thee absent from me now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some bid their dead "Good night!" but I will say<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She bent me with the motion of her sphere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made me feel what first I did but fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But when I came to age, and had o'ergrown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her rules, and saw my freedom was my own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did reply unto the laws of Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made my reason my great advocate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I labour'd to inherit my just right;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But then&mdash;O, hear Etesia!&mdash;lest I might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Redeem myself, my unkind starry mother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took my poor heart, and gave it to another.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Happy is he, that with fix'd eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fountain of all goodness spies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Happy is he that can break through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those bonds which tie him here below!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Thracian poet long ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kind Orpheus, full of tears and woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did for his lov'd Eurydice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In such sad numbers mourn, that he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made the trees run in to his moan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And streams stand still to hear him groan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The does came fearless in one throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lions to his mournful song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And charmed by the harmonious sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hare stay'd by the quiet hound.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But when Love height'n'd by despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deep reflections on his fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had swell'd his heart, and made it rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And run in tears out at his eyes,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And those sweet airs, which did appease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild beasts, could give their lord no ease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, vex'd that so much grief and love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mov'd not at all the gods above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With desperate thoughts and bold intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards the shades below he went;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thither his fair love was fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he must have her from the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There in such lines, as did well suit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sad airs and a lover's lute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the richest language dress'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That could be thought on or express'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did he complain; whatever grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or art or love&mdash;which is the chief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all ennobles&mdash;could lay out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In well-tun'd woes he dealt about.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And humbly bowing to the prince<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ghosts begg'd some intelligence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his Eurydice, and where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His beauteous saint resided there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to his lute's instructed groans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sigh'd out new melodious moans;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a melting, charming strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begg'd his dear love to life again.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The music flowing through the shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And darkness did with ease invade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silent and attentive ghosts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cerberus, which guards those coasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his loud barkings, overcome<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
<span class="i0">By the sweet notes, was now struck dumb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Furies, us'd to rave and howl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prosecute each guilty soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had lost their rage, and in a deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transport, did most profusely weep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ixion's wheel stopp'd, and the curs'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tantalus, almost kill'd with thirst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the streams now did make no haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wait'd for him, none would taste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That vulture, which fed still upon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tityus his liver, now was gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feed on air, and would not stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though almost famish'd, with her prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Won with these wonders, their fierce prince<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last cried out, "We yield! and since<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy merits claim no less, take hence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy consort for thy recompense:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Orpheus, to this law we bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our grant: you must not look behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor of your fair love have one sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till out of our dominions quite."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alas! what laws can lovers awe?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love is itself the greatest law!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or who can such hard bondage brook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be in love, and not to look?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Orpheus almost in the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost his dear love for one short sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by those eyes, which Love did guide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What he most lov'd unkindly died!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
<span class="i2">This tale of Orpheus and his love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was meant for you, who ever move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upwards, and tend into that light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which is not seen by mortal sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if, while you strive to ascend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You droop, and towards Earth once bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your seduc'd eyes, down you will fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n while you look, and forfeit all.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What fast, inviolable tie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole creation to her ends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever provident she bends:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All this I purpose to rehearse<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their rage which slept, stirr'd by that food<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In furious roaring will awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fiercely for their freedom make.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No chains nor bars their fury brooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with enrag'd and bloody looks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They will break through, and dull'd with fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their keeper all to pieces tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The bird, which on the wood's tall boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sings sweetly, if you cage or house,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To give her honey with her drink,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And get her store of pleasant meat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n such as she delights to eat:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, if from her close prison she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shady groves doth chance to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straightway she loathes her pleasant food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with sad looks longs for the wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wood, the wood alone she loves!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And towards it she looks and moves:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in sweet notes&mdash;though distant from&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sings to her first and happy home!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That plant, which of itself doth grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upwards, if forc'd, will downwards bow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But give it freedom, and it will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Get up, and grow erectly still.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sun, which by his prone descent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems westward in the evening bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth nightly by an unseen way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haste to the East, and bring up day.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus all things long for their first state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gladly to't return, though late.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is there here to anything<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A course allow'd, but in a ring:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, where it first began, must end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to that point directly tend.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A grove there grows, round with the sea confin'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the Indies and the Eastern wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, as the sun breaks forth in his first beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Salutes his steeds, and hears him whip his team;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When with his dewy coach the Eastern bay<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And with renew'd limbs tires ev'ry age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His appetite he never doth assuage<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When thirsty on some river's muddy brink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A purer, vital heat shot from the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth nourish him, and airy sweets that come<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
<span class="i0">From Tethys lap he tasteth at his need;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On such abstracted diet doth he feed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A secret light there streams from both his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fiery hue about his cheeks doth rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His crest grows up into a glorious star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Giv'n t' adorn his head, and shines so far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That piercing through the bosom of the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It rends the darkness with a gladsome light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His thighs like Tyrian scarlet, and his wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;More swift than winds are&mdash;have sky-colour'd rings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flow'ry and rich: and round about enroll'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their utmost borders glister all with gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's not conceiv'd, nor springs he from the Earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But is himself the parent, and the birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None him begets; his fruitful death reprieves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old age, and by his funerals he lives.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when the tedious Summer's gone about<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So many Springs: and May doth still restore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those leaves, which Autumn had blown off before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then press'd with years his vigour doth decline,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foil'd with the number; as a stately pine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tir'd out with storms bends from the top and height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Caucasus, and falls with its own weight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose part is torn with daily blasts, with rain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Part is consum'd, and part with age again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So now his eyes grown dusky, fail to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far off, and drops of colder rheums there be<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Fall'n slow and dreggy from them; such in sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cloudy moon is, having spent her light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now his wings, which us&egrave;d to contend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tempests, scarce from the low earth ascend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knows his time is out! and doth provide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New principles of life; herbs he brings dried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the hot hills, and with rich spices frames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pile, shall burn, and hatch him with its flames.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this the weakling sits; salutes the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pleasant noise, and prays and begs for some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his own fire, that quickly may restore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth and vigour, which he had before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom, soon as Ph&oelig;bus spies, stopping his reins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He makes a stand and thus allays his pains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O thou that buriest old age in thy grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And art by seeming funerals to have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A new return of life, whose custom 'tis<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ev'n death itself, a new beginning take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that thy wither'd body now forsake!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better thyself by this thy change! This said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shakes his locks, and from his golden head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoots one bright beam, which smites with vital fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The willing bird; to burn is his desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he may live again: he's proud in death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And goes in haste to gain a better breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spicy heap fir'd with celestial rays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth burn the aged Ph&oelig;nix, when straight stays<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The chariot of th' amaz&egrave;d moon; the pole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resists the wheeling swift orbs, and the whole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fabric of Nature at a stand remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the old bird a new young being gains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All stop and charge the faithful flames, that they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suffer not Nature's glory to decay.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By this time, life which in the ashes lurks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath fram'd the heart, and taught new blood new works;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole heap stirs, and ev'ry part assumes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Due vigour; th' embers too are turn'd to plumes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The parent in the issue now revives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But young and brisk; the bounds of both these lives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With very little space between the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were parted only by the middle flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To Nilus straight he goes to consecrate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His parent's ghost; his mind is to translate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His dust to Egypt. Now he hastes away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a distant land, and doth convey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ashes in a turf. Birds do attend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His journey without number, and defend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pious flight, like to a guard; the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is clouded with the army, as they fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is there one of all those thousands dares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Affront his leader: they with solemn cares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attend the progress of their youthful king;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the rude hawk, nor th' eagle that doth bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arms up to Jove, fight now, lest they displease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The miracle enacts a common peace.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So doth the Parthian lead from Tigris' side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His barbarous troops, full of a lavish pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In pearls and habit; he adorns his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With royal tires: his steed with gold is led;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His robes, for which the scarlet fish is sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rare Assyrian needle-work are wrought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And proudly reigning o'er his rascal bands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He raves and triumphs in his large commands.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A city of Egypt, famous in all lands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For rites, adores the sun; his temple stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There on a hundred pillars by account,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Digg'd from the quarries of the Theban mount.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, as the custom did require&mdash;they say&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His happy parent's dust down he doth lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the image of his lord he bends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the flames his burden straight commends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the altars thus he destinates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own remains; the light doth gild the gates;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perfumes divine the censers up do send:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While th' Indian odour doth itself extend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Pelusian fens, and filleth all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men it meets with the sweet storm. A gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which compar'd nectar itself is vile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fills the sev'n channels of the misty Nile.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O happy bird! sole heir to thy own dust!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death, to whose force all other creatures must<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Submit, saves thee. Thy ashes make thee rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis not thy nature, but thy age that dies.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast seen all! and to the times that run<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The punishment still manifests the sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As outward signs show the disease within.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While worth oppress'd mounts to a nobler height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And palm-like bravely overtops the weight.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So where swift Isca from our lofty hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With loud farewells descends, and foaming fills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wider channel, like some great port-vein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With large rich streams to fill the humble plain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw an oak, whose stately height and shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Projected far, a goodly shelter made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the top with thick diffus&egrave;d boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In distant rounds grew like a wood-nymph's house.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here many garlands won at roundel-lays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old shepherds hung up in those happy days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With knots and girdles, the dear spoils and dress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of such bright maids as did true lovers bless.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many times had old Amphion made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His beauteous flock acquainted with this shade:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His flock, whose fleeces were as smooth and white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As those the welkin shows in moonshine night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, when the careless world did sleep, have I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dark records and numbers nobly high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The visions of our black, but brightest bard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From old Amphion's mouth full often heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all those plagues poor shepherds since have known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And riddles more, which future time must own:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
<span class="i0">While on his pipe young Hylas play'd, and made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Music as solemn as the song and shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the curs'd owner from the trembling top<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the firm brink did all those branches lop;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in one hour what many years had bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pride and beauty of the plain, lay dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The undone swains in sad songs mourn'd their loss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While storms and cold winds did improve the cross;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nature, which&mdash;like virtue&mdash;scorns to yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought new recruits and succours to the field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For by next spring the check'd sap wak'd from sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And upwards still to feel the sun did creep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at those wounds, the hated hewer made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There sprang a thicker and a fresher shade.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From south to north, and back to southern coasts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to the starry orb, which in its round<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For north, there is&mdash;some guess&mdash;a trembling fit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shivering in the part that's opposite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What were our fears and pantings, what dire fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard we of Irish tumults, sword, and flame!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which now we think but blessings, as being sent<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The same kind virtue doth at once disclose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauty of their thistle and our rose.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But use my own, as if mine were not mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wealth I'll not wonder at, nor greatness seek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But choose&mdash;though laugh'd at&mdash;to be poor and meek.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In woe and wealth I'll keep the same staid mind,<br /></span>

<h3>POEMS WITH THE TENTH SATIRE OF JUVENAL ENGLISHED.</h3>

<p>Most of the poems in this volume of 1646 appear to belong to
Vaughan's sojourn as a law-student in London: that, however,
on the Priory Grove must have been written after he had
retired to Wales on the outbreak of the Civil War.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_5">5</a>. To my Ingenious Friend, R. W.</h4>

<p>It is probable that this is the R. W. of the Elegy in <i>Olor
Iscanus</i> (p. 79). On the attempts to identify him, see the note
to that poem. The <i>Poems</i> of 1646 must have been published
while his fate was still unknown.</p>

<p><i>Pints i' th' Moon or Star.</i> These are names of rooms,
rather than of inns. <i>Cf.</i> Shakespeare, 1 <i>Henry IV.</i>, ii. 4, 30,
"Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon."</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_6">6</a>. <i>Randolph.</i></h4>

<p>The works of Randolph here referred to
are his comedy <i>The Jealous Lovers</i>, his pastoral <i>Amyntas;
or, The Impossible Dowry</i>, and the following verses <i>On the
Death of a Nightingale</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Go, solitary wood, and henceforth be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acquainted with no other harmony<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Than the pie's chattering, or the shrieking note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of boding owls, and fatal raven's throat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy sweetest chanter's dead, that warbled forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lays that might tempests calm, and still the north,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And call down angels from their glorious sphere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear her songs, and learn new anthems there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That soul is fled, and to Elysium gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou a poor desert left; go then and run.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beg there to want a grove, and if she please<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sing again beneath thy shadowy trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The souls of happy lovers crowned with blisses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall flock about thee, and keep time with kisses."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_8">8</a>. Les Amours.</h4>

<p>Lines 22-24 are misprinted in the original; they there run:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O'er all the tomb a sudden spring:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If crimson flowers, whose drooping heads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall curtain o'er their mournful heads:"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_10">10</a>. To Amoret.</h4>

<p>The Amoret of these <i>Poems</i> may or may not be the Etesia
of <i>Thalia Rediviva</i>; and she may or may not have been the
poet's first wife. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Introduction</i> (vol. i, p. xxxiii).</p>

<p><i>To her white bosom.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Hamlet</i>, ii. 2, 113, where Hamlet
addresses a letter to Ophelia, "in her excellent white bosom,
these."</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_12">12</a>. Song.</h4>

<p>The MS. variant readings to this and to two of the following
poems are written in pencil on a copy of the <i>Poems</i> in the
British Museum, having the press-mark 12304, a 24. There is
no indication of their author, or of the source from which they
are taken.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>. To Amoret.</h4>

<p><i>The vast ring.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Silex Scintillans</i>
(vol. i., pp. 150, 284).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_18">18</a>. <i>A Rhapsodis.</i></h4>

<p><i>The Globe Tavern.</i> This appears to have been near, or even
a part of, the famous theatre. There exists a forged letter of
George Peele's, in which it is mentioned as a resort of Shakespeare's,
but there is no authentic allusion to it by name earlier
than an entry in the registers of St. Saviour's, Southwark, for
1637. An "alehouse" is, however, alluded to in a ballad on
the burning of the old Globe in 1613. (Rendle and Norman,
<i>Inns of Old Southwark</i>, p. 326.)</p>

<p><i>Tower-Wharf to Cymbeline and Lud</i>; that is, from the
extreme east to the extreme west of the City. Statues of the
mythical kings of Britain were set up in 1260 in niches on
Ludgate. They were renewed when the gate was rebuilt in
1586. It stood near the Church of St. Martin's, Ludgate.</p>

<p><i>That made his horse a senator</i>; <i>i.e.</i> Caligula.
<i>Cf.</i> Suetonius Vit. Caligulae, 55:
"<i>Incitato equo, cuius causa pridie
circenses, ne inquietaretur, viciniae silentium per milites
indicere solebat, praeter equile marmoreum et praesepe eburneum
praeterque purpurea tegumenta ac monilia e gemmis,
domum etiam et familiam et suppellectilem dedit, quo lautius
nomine eius invitati acciperentur; consulatum quoque
traditur destinasse.</i>"</p>

<p><i>he that ... crossed Rubicon</i>, <i>i.e.</i> Julius C&aelig;sar.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_21">21</a>. To Amoret.</h4>

<p>The third stanza is closely modelled on Donne; <i>cf.</i> Introduction
(vol. i., p. xxi). The curious reader may detect many
other traces of Donne's manner of writing in these <i>Poems</i> of
1646.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>. To Amoret Weeping.</h4>

<p><i>Eat orphans ... patent it.</i> The ambition of a courtier
under the Stuarts was to get the guardianship of a royal
ward, or the grant of a monopoly in some article of necessity.
Dr. Grosart quotes from Tustin's <i>Observations; or, Conscience
Emblem</i> (1646): "By me, John Tustin, who hath
been plundered and spoiled by the patentees for white and grey
soap, eighteen several times, to his utter undoing."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_26">26</a>. Upon the Priory Grove, his usual Retirement.</h4>

<p>Mr. Beeching, in the <i>Introduction</i> (vol. i., p. xxiii), states
following Dr. Grosart, that the Priory Grove was "the home of
a famous poetess of the day, Katherine Phillips, better known
as 'the Matchless Orinda.'" Vaughan was certainly a friend
of Mrs. Phillips (<i>cf.</i> pp. 100, 164, 211, with notes), whose
husband, Colonel James Phillips, lived at the Priory, Cardigan;
but she was not married until 1647.</p>

<p>Miss Morgan points out that there is still a wood on the outskirts
of Brecon which is known as the Priory Grove. It is
near the church and remains of a Benedictine Priory on the
Honddu.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_28">28</a>. Juvenal's Tenth Satire Translated.</h4>

<p>This translation has a separate title-page;
<i>cf.</i> the <i>Bibliography</i> (vol. ii., p. lvii).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>


<h3>OLOR ISCANUS.</h3>


<p>This volume, published in 1651, contains, besides the poems
here reprinted, some prose translations from Plutarch and
other writers. The separate title-pages of these are given in
the <i>Bibliography</i> (vol. ii., p. lviii): the incidental scraps of
verse in them appear on pp. 291-293 of the present volume.
The edition of 1651 has, besides the printed title-page, an
engraved title-page by the well-known engraver, who may or
may not have been a kinsman of the poet, Robert Vaughan.
It represents a swan on a river shaded by trees. The <i>Olor
Iscanus</i> was reissued with a fresh title-page in 1679.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_52">52</a>. Ad Posteros.</h4>

<p>On the account of Vaughan's life here given, see the <i>Biographical
note</i> (vol. ii., p. xxx).</p>

<p><i>Herbertus.</i> Matthew Herbert, Rector of Llangattock.
Cf. the poem to him on p. 158, with its note.</p>

<p><i>Castae fidaeque ... parentis</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, perhaps, his mother
the Church.</p>

<p><i>Nec manus atra fuit.</i> Dr. Grosart omitted the <i>fuit</i>,
together with the final <i>s</i> of the preceding line. In this he is
na&iuml;vely followed by Mr. J. R. Tutin, in his selection of
Vaughan's <i>Secular Poems</i>.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_53">53</a>. To the ... Lord Kildare Digby.</h4>

<p>Lord Kildare Digby was the eldest son of Robert, first Baron
Digby, in the peerage of Ireland. He succeeded to the title in
1642. He was about 21 at the time of this dedication, and
died in 1661 (Dr. Grosart)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>


<p>The date of the dedication is 17th of December, 1647. A
volume was therefore probably prepared for publication at that
date, and afterwards, as we learn from the publisher's preface,
"condemned to obscurity," and given surreptitiously to the
world. At the same time, as Miss Morgan points out to me,
some of the poems in <i>Olor Iscanus</i> must be of later date than
1647. The death of Charles I. is apparently alluded to in the
lines <i>Ad Posteros</i>, and certainly in the "since Charles his
reign" of the <i>Invitation to Brecknock</i> (p. 74). This event
took place on January 30th, 1648/9. The <i>Epitaph upon the
Lady Elizabeth</i> (p. 102), again, cannot be earlier than her death
on September 8th, 1650.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_54">54</a>. The Publisher to the Reader.</h4>

<p><i>Augustus vindex.</i> The lives of Vergil attributed to Donatus
and others relate that the poet, in his will, directed that his
unfinished <i>Aeneid</i> should be burnt. Augustus, however, interfered
and ordered its publication.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_57">57</a>. Commendatory Verses.</h4>

<p>These are signed by <i>T. Powell, Oxoniensis</i>; <i>I. Rowlandson,
Oxoniensis</i>; and <i>Eugenius Philalethes, Oxoniensis</i>. Thomas
Powell, one of the Powells of Cantreff, in Breconshire, was
born in 1608. He matriculated from Jesus College on January
25th, 1627/8, took his B.A. in 1629 and his M.A. in 1632, and
became a Fellow of the College. He was Rector of Cantreff
and Vicar of Brecknock, but was ejected by the Commissioners
for the Propagation of the Gospel and went abroad. At the
Restoration he returned to Cantreff and was made D.D.
and Canon of St. David's. But for his death, on the 31st
December, 1660, he would probably have become Bishop of
Bristol. He was the author of several books of no great importance.
He appears to have been a close friend of
Vaughan, who addresses various poems to him, and contributed
others to his books. See <i>Olor Iscanus</i>, pp. 97, 159;
<i>Thalia Rediviva</i>, pp. 178, 200, 267; <i>Fragments and
Translations</i>, pp. 323-326. Powell, in return, wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
commendatory poems to both the <i>Olor Iscanus</i> and the <i>Thalia
Rediviva</i>.</p>

<p><i>I. Rowlandson.</i> This may have been John Rowlandson, of
Queen's College, Oxford, who matriculated the 17th October,
1634, aged 17, took his B.A. in 1636, and his M.A. in 1639.
Either he or his father, James Rowlandson, also of Queen's
College, was sequestered by the Westminster Assembly to the
vicarage of Battle, Sussex, in 1644. He left it shortly after
and "returned to his benefice from whence he was before
thence driven by the forces raised against the parliament."
(<i>See</i> Addl. MS. 15,669, f. 17). There was also another James
Rowlandson, son of James Rowlandson, D.D., Canon of
Windsor, who matriculated from Queen's College on the 9th
November, 1632, aged 17, and took his B.A. in 1637.&mdash;G. G.</p>

<p><i>Eugenius Philalethes.</i> The author's brother, Thomas
Vaughan. See the <i>Biographical Note</i> (vol. ii., p. xxxiii).</p>

<p>P. 39. <i>that lamentable nation</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the Scotch.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_61">61</a>. Olor Iscanus.</h4>

<p><i>Ausonius.</i> The famous schoolmaster, rhetorician and courtier
of the early fourth century, was born at Bordeaux. One of his
most famous poems is the <i>Mosella</i> (Idyll X), a description of
the river and its fish.</p>

<p><i>Castara</i>, Lucy, daughter of William Herbert, Lord Powys,
and wife of the Worcestershire poet, William Habington, who
celebrated her in his poems under that name. The <i>Castara</i>
was published in 1634.</p>

<p><i>Sabrina</i>, the tutelar nymph of the Severn. <i>Cf.</i> the invocation
of her in Milton's "Comus."</p>

<p><i>May the evet and the toad.</i> This passage is imitated from

<h4>P. <a href="#Page_70">70</a>. To his Friend &mdash;&mdash;.</h4>

<p>Miss Morgan thinks that the "friend" of this poem, whose
name is shown by the first line to have been James, may
perhaps be identified with the James Howell of the <i>Epistolae
Ho-Elianae</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Howell had Vaughans amongst his cousins and
correspondents, but these appear to have been of the Golden
Grove family.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_73">73</a>. To his retired Friend&mdash;an Invitation to Brecknock.</h4>

<p><i>her foul, polluted walls.</i> Miss Morgan quotes a statement
from Grose's <i>Antiquities</i> to the effect that the walls of Brecknock
were pulled down by the inhabitants during the Civil
War in order to avoid having to support a garrison or stand a
siege.</p>

<p><i>the Greek</i>, <i>i.e.</i> Hercules when in love with Omphale.</p>

<p><i>Domitian-like</i>: <i>Cf.</i> Suetonius, <i>Vita Domitiani</i>, 3:
"<i>Inter initia principatus cotidie secretum sibi horarum sumere
solebat, nec quicquam amplius quam muscas captare ac stilo
praeacuto configere.</i>"</p>

<p><i>Since Charles his reign.</i> This poem must date from after
the execution of Charles I., on January 30, 1648/9. It would
appear therefore that Vaughan was living in Brecknock and
not at Newton about the time that the <i>Olor Iscanus</i> was
published.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_77">77</a>. Monsieur Gombauld.</h4>

<p>The writer referred to is John Ogier de Gombauld (1567-1666).
His prose tale of <i>Endymion</i> was translated by Richard
Hurst in 1637. <i>Ismena</i> and <i>Diophania</i> who was metamorphosed
into a myrtle, are characters in the story. <i>Periardes</i>
is a hill in Armenia whence the Euphrates takes its course.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_79">79</a>. An Elegy on the Death of Mr. R. W., slain
in the late unfortunate differences at Routon
Heath, near Chester.</h4>

<p>The battle of Routon, or Rowton, Heath took place on
September 24, 1645. The Royalist forces, under Charles I. and
Sir Marmaduke Langdale, advancing to raise the siege of
Chester, were met and routed by the Parliamentarians under
Poyntz. The contemporary pamphlets give a long list of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
prisoners taken at Routon Heath, but name hardly any of
those slain. It is therefore difficult to say who R. W.,
evidently a dear friend of Vaughan's, may have been. He
appears to have been missing for a year before he was finally
given up. From lines 25-27 we learn that he was a young
man of only twenty. The most likely suggestion for his identification
seems to me that of Mr. C. H. Firth, who points out
to me that the name of one Roger Wood occurs in the list of
Catholics who fell in the King's service as having been slain at
Chester. Miss Southall (<i>Songs of Siluria</i>, 1890, p. 124)
suggests that he may have been either Richard Williams,
a nephew of Sir Henry Williams, of Gwernyfed, who died
unmarried, or else a son of Richard Winter, of Llangoed.
He might also, I think, have been one of Vaughan's wife's
family, the Wises, and possibly also a Walbeoffe. A reference
to the Walbeoffe pedigree in the note to p. 189 will show that
there was a Robert Walbeoffe, brother of C. W. Miss Morgan
thinks that he is a generation too old, and that the unnamed
son of C. W., who, according to his tombstone, did not survive
him, may have been a Robert, and the R. W. in question.
On the question whether Vaughan was himself present at
Routon Heath, <i>see</i> the <i>Biographical Note</i> (vol. ii., p. xxviii).</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_83">83</a>. Upon a Cloak lent him by Mr. J. Ridsley.</h4>

<p>I do not know who Mr. Ridsley was. On the references to
Vaughan's "juggling fate of soldiery" in this poem, <i>see</i> the
<i>Biographical Note</i> (vol. ii., p. xxviii).</p>

<p><i>craggy Biston, and the fatal Dee.</i> Chester stands, of
course, on the Dee, which is "fatal" as the scene of disasters
to the Royalist cause. Dr. Grosart explains Biston as "Bishton
(or Bishopstone) in Monmouthshire," and adds, "'Craggie
Biston' refers, no doubt, to certain caves there. The Poet's
school-boy rambles from Llangattock doubtless included
Bishton." I think that Biston is clearly Beeston Castle, one
of the outlying defences of Chester, which played a considerable
part in the siege. It surrendered on November 5, 1645,
and the small garrison was permitted to march to Denbigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
(J. R. Phillips, <i>The Civil War in Wales and the Marshes</i>,
vol. i., p. 343).</p>

<p><i>Micro-cosmography</i>, the world represented on a small scale in
man. Vaughan means that he had as many lines on him as a map.</p>

<p><i>Speed's Old Britons.</i> John Speed (1555-1629) published his
<i>History of Great Britain</i> in 1614.</p>

<p><i>King Harry's Chapel at Westminster</i>, with its tombs, was
already one of the sights of London.</p>

<p><i>Brownist.</i> The Brownists were the religious followers of
Robert Browne (c. 1550-c. 1633); they were afterwards known
as Independents or Congregationalists.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_86">86</a>. Upon Mr. Fletcher's Plays.</h4>

<p>The first folio edition of Beaumont and Fletcher's <i>Comedies
and Tragedies</i> was published in 1647. Vaughan's lines are
not, however, amongst the commendatory verses there given.</p>

<p><i>Field's or Swansted's overthrow.</i> Nathaniel Field and
Eliard Swanston, who appears to be meant by Swansted, were
well-known actors. They were both members of the King's
Company about 1633.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_90">90</a>. Upon the Poems and Plays of the ever-memorable
Mr. William Cartwright.</h4>

<p>This was printed, together with verses by Tho. Vaughan
and many other writers, in William Cartwright's <i>Comedies,
Tragi-comedies, with other Poems</i>, 1651.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_94">94</a>. An Elegy on the Death of Mr. R. Hall, slain
at Pontefract, 1648.</h4>

<p>Miss Southall thinks that the subject of this elegy may have
been a son of Richard Hall, of High Meadow, in the Forest of
Dean, co. Gloucester. These Halls were connected with the
Winters, a Breconshire family. Mr. C. H. Firth ingeniously
suggests to me that for R. Hall we should read R. Hall[ifax],
and points out that a Robert Hallyfax was one of the garrison
at the first siege of Pontefract in 1645. He may have been at
the second siege also. (R. Holmes, <i>Sieges of Pontefract</i>, p. 20.)

<h4>P. <a href="#Page_97">97</a>. To my learned Friend, Mr. T. Powell, upon
his Translation of Malvezzi's "Christian Politician."</h4>

<p>The book referred to is <i>The Pourtract of the Politicke
Christian-Favourite</i>. By Marquesse Virgilio Malvezzi, 1647.
This is a translation of <i>Il Ritratto del Privato Politico Christiano</i>,
published at Bologna in 1635. It does not contain
Vaughan's verses, and no translator's name is given. The
preface of another translation from Malvezzi, the <i>Stoa
Triumphans</i> (1651), is, however, signed "T. P."</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_99">99</a>. To my worthy Friend, Master T. Lewes.</h4>

<p>Some of the lines in this poem are borrowed from Horace's
verses, <i>Ad Thaliarcham</i> (Book I., Ode 9):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Vides, ut alta stet nive candida<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soracte, nec iam sustineant onus<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Appone."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p style='text-align:right; margin-right:2em;'>G. G.</p>

<p>Dr. Grosart thinks that T. Lewes was "probably of Maes-mawr,
opposite Newton, on the south side of the Usk." Miss
Southall identifies him with Thomas Lewis, incumbent in 1635
of Llanfigan, near Llansantffread. He was expelled from his
living, but returned to it at the Restoration.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_100">100</a>. To the most excellently accomplished Mrs. K. Philips.</h4>

<p>Katherine Philips, by birth Katherine Fowler, became the
wife in 1647 of Colonel James Philips, of the Priory, Cardigan.
She was a wit and poetess, and well-known to a large
circle of friends as "the matchless Orinda." Each member of
her coterie had a similar fantastic pseudonym, and it is possible
that this may account for the Etesia and Timander, the Fida<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
and Lysimachus, of Vaughan's poems. The poems of Orinda
were surreptitiously published in 1664, and in an authorised
version in 1667. They include her poem on Vaughan, afterwards
prefixed to <i>Thalia Rediviva</i> (cf. p. 169), but are not
accompanied by the present verses nor by those to her editor
in <i>Thalia Rediviva</i> (p. 211).</p>

<p><i>A Persian votary</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, a Parsee, or fire-worshipper.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_102">102</a>. An Epitaph upon the Lady Elizabeth, Second
Daughter to his late Majesty.</h4>

<p>Elizabeth, second daughter of Charles I., was born in 1635.
She suffered from ill-health and grief after her father's execution,
and died at Carisbrooke on September 8, 1650. This
poem, therefore, like others in the volume, must be of later
date than the dedication.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_104">104</a>. To Sir William Davenant, upon his Gondibert.</h4>

<p>Davenant's <i>Gondibert</i> was first published in 1651. It does
not contain Vaughan's verses.</p>

<p><i>thy aged sire.</i> Is this an allusion to the story that Davenant
was in reality the son of William Shakespeare?</p>

<p><i>Birtha</i>, the heroine of <i>Gondibert</i>.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_119">119</a>. Cupido [Cruci Affixus].</h4>

<p>Another translation of Ausonius' poems was published by
Thomas Stanley in 1649. There is nothing in the original
corresponding to the last four lines of Vaughan's translation.</p>

<p>Ll. 89-94. The Latin is:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Se quisque absolvere gestit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transferat ut proprias aliena in crimina culpas."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Vaughan's simile is borrowed from Donne's <i>Fourth Elegy</i>
(<i>Muses' Library</i>, I., 107):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"as a thief at bar is questioned there,<br /></span>

<h4>P. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>. Translations from Boethius.</h4>

<p>These translations are from the <i>De Consolatione Philosophiae</i>,
a medley of prose and verse. Vaughan has translated
all the verse in the first two books except the Metrum 3 of
Book I. and Metrum 6 of Book II. The headings of Metra 7
and 8 of Book II. are given in error in <i>Olor Iscanus</i> as
Metra 6 and 7. Some further translations from Books III. and
IV. will be found in <i>Thalia Rediviva</i>, pp. 224-235.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_144">144</a>. Translations from Casimirus.</h4>

<p>These translations are from the Polish poet Mathias Casimirus
Sarbievius, or Sarbiewski (1595-1640). His Latin <i>Lyrics</i>
and <i>Epodes</i>, modelled on Horace, were published in 1625-1631.
Sarbiewski was a Jesuit, and a complete edition of his poems
was published by the Jesuits in 1892.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_158">158</a>. Venerabili viro, praeceptori suo olim et
semper colendissimo Magistro Mathaeo Herbert.</h4>

<p>Matthew Herbert was Rector of Llangattock, and apparently
acted as tutor to the young Vaughans. He is mentioned in
the lines <i>Ad Posteros</i> (p. 51). Thomas Vaughan also has
two sets of Latin verses to him (Grosart, II., 349), and dedicated
to him his <i>Man-Mouse taken in a Trap</i> (1650). On July 19,
1655, he petitioned for the discharge of the sequestration on his
rectory, which had been sequestered for the delinquency of the
Earl of Worcester (<i>Cal. Proc. Ctee. for Compositions</i>, p. 1713).
He died in 1660.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_159">159</a>. Praestantissimo viro Thomae Po&euml;llo in
suum de Elementis Optic&aelig; Libellum.</h4>

<p>The <i>Elementa Opticae</i> appeared in 1649. It has no name
on the title-page, but the preface is signed "T. P.," and
dated 1649. It contains the present prefatory verses, together
with some others, also in Latin, by Eugenius Philalethes
(Thomas Vaughan).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>


<h3>THALIA REDIVIVA.</h3>


<p>This volume, published in 1578, at a late date in Henry
Vaughan's life, twenty-three years after the second part of
<i>Silex Scintillans</i>, must have been written, at least in part,
much earlier. The poem on <i>The King Disguised</i>, for instance,
goes back to 1646. At the end of the volume, with a
separate title-page (<i>cf.</i> <i>Bibliography</i>), come the Verse Remains
of the poet's brother, Thomas Vaughan. This is the rarest of
Vaughan's collections of poems. The copy once in Mr. Corser's
collection, and now in the British Museum, was believed to be
unique. It was used both by Lyte and Dr. Grosart. But
Miss Morgan has come across two other copies, one in Mr.
Locker-Lampson's library at Rowfant, the other in that of Mr.
Joseph, at Brecon.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_163">163</a>. The Epistle-Dedicatory.</h4>

<p>Henry Somerset, third Marquis of Worcester, was created
Duke of Beaufort in 1682. He was a distant kinsman of
Vaughan's, whose great-great-grandfather, William Vaughan
of Tretower, married Frances Somerset, granddaughter of
Henry, Earl of Worcester. He was a firm adherent of the
Stuarts, and refused to take the oath of allegiance to
William III. (Dr. Grosart).</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_164">164</a>. Commendatory Verses.</h4>

<p>These are signed by <i>Orinda</i>; <i>Tho. Powell, D.D.</i>; <i>N. W.,
Ies. Coll., Oxon.</i>; <i>I. W., A.M. Oxon.</i></p>

<p>On Orinda, <i>cf.</i> the note to p. 100, and on Dr. Powell, that to P. 57.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Firth suggests that N. W., of Jesus, probably a young
man, who imitates Cowley's <i>Pindarics</i>, and does not claim any
personal acquaintance with Vaughan, may be N[athaniel]
W[illiams], son of Thomas Williams, of Swansea, who matriculated
in 1672, or N[icholas] W[adham], of Rhydodyn,
Carmarthen, who matriculated in 1669.</p>

<p>I. W., also an Oxford man, is probably the writer of the
prefaces to the Marquis of Worcester and to the Reader, which
are signed respectively J. W. and I. W. Mr. Firth suggests
that he may be J[ohn] W[illiams], son of Sir Henry Williams
of Gwernevet, Brecon, who matriculated at Brasenose in 1642.
I have thought that he might be Vaughan's cousin, the second
John Walbeoffe (<i>cf.</i> p. 189, <i>note</i>), who is mentioned in Thomas
Vaughan's diary (<i>cf.</i> <i>Biographical Note</i>, vol. ii., p. xxxviii),
but there is no proof that Walbeoffe was an Oxford man.
Perhaps he is the friend James to whom a poem in <i>Olor
Iscanus</i> is addressed (p. 70).</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_178">178</a>. To his Learned Friend and loyal Fellow-prisoner,
Thomas Powel of Cant[reff], Doctor of Divinity.</h4>

<p>On Dr. Powell, <i>cf.</i> note to p. 57. Vaughan's reason for
calling him a "fellow-prisoner" is discussed in the <i>Biographical
Note</i> (vol. ii., p. xxxii).</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_181">181</a>. The King Disguised.</h4>

<p>John Cleveland's poem, <i>The King's Disguise</i>, here referred
to, was first published as a pamphlet on January 21, 1646. It
appears in Cleveland's <i>Works</i> (1687). The disguising was on
the occasion of Charles the First's flight, on April 27, 1646,
from Oxford to the Scottish camp, of which Dr. Gardiner
writes (<i>History of the Civil War</i>, Ch. xli): "At three in
the morning of the 27th, Charles, disguised as a servant, with
his beard and hair closely trimmed, passed over Magdalen
Bridge in apparent attendance upon Ashburnham and Hudson."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_187">187</a>. To Mr. M. L., upon his Reduction of the Psalms into Method.</h4>

<p>Dr. Grosart identifies M. L. with Matthew Locke, of whom
Roger North says, in his <i>Memoirs of Music</i> (4to, 1846, p. 96):
"He set most of the Psalms to music in parts, for the use of
some vertuoso ladyes in the city." Locke's setting of the
<i>Psalms</i> exists only in MS. A copy was in the library of Dr.
E. F. Rimbault, who thinks that the author assisted Playford
in his <i>Whole Book of Psalms</i> (1677). In 1677 he died.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_189">189</a>. To the pious Memory of C[harles] W[albeoffe] Esquire.</h4>

<p>Charles Walbeoffe was a man of considerable importance in
Brecknockshire. His name occurs several times in State
papers of the period. A petition of his concerning a ward is
dated October 12, 1640. (<i>Cal. S. P. Dom.</i>, Car. I., 470, 113).
He was High Sheriff in 1648 (Harl. MS. 2,289, f. 174), and a
fragment of a warrant signed by him on April 17 of that year
to Thomas Vaughan, treasurer of the county, for the monthly
assessment, is in Harl. MS. 6,831, f. 13. As we might perhaps
gather from Vaughan's poem, he does not seem to have taken
an active part in the Civil War. He did not, like some
other members of his family, sign the <i>Declaration</i> of Brecknock
for the Parliament on November 23, 1645 (J. R. Phillips,
<i>Civil War in Wales and the Marches</i>, ii. 284). And he
seems to have joined the Royalist rising in Wales of 1648.
Information was laid on February 10, 1649, that he "was
Commissioner of Array and Association, raised men and money,
subscribed warrants to raise men against the Parliament's
generals, and sat as J.P. in the court at Brecon when the
friends of Parliament were prosecuted" (<i>Cal. Proc. Ctee. for
Advance of Money</i>, p. 1017). Afterwards he was reconciled,
sat on the local Committee for Compositions, and again got
into trouble with the authorities. On May 14, 1652, the
Brecon Committee wrote to the Central Committee that, being
one of the late Committee, he would not account for sums in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
his hands. He was fined &pound;20. (<i>Cal. Proc. Ctee. for Compositions</i>,
p. 578.)</p>

<p>Miss Morgan has copied the inscription on his tombstone in
Llanhamlach Church.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p style='text-align:center;'>[Arms of Walbeoffe.]</p>

<p>"Here lieth the body of Charles Walbeoffe, Esqre., who
departed this life the 13th day of September, 1653, and was
married to Mary, one of the daughters of Sir Thomas Aubrey
of Llantryddid, in the county of Glamorgan, Knt., by whom
he had issue two sonnes, of whom only Charles surviveth."</p>
</div>

<p>Charles Walbeoffe the younger died in 1668, and was
succeeded by his cousin John. "This gentleman," says Jones
(<i>Hist. of Brecknock</i>, ii., 482), "being of a gay and extravagant
turn, left the estate, much encumbered, to his son Charles,
and soon after his death it was foreclosed and afterwards sold."</p>

<p>This John Walbeoffe is mentioned in Thomas Vaughan's
<i>Diary</i> (<i>cf.</i> vol. ii., p. xxxviii). He may be the writer of the
preface to <i>Thalia Rediviva</i> (<i>cf.</i> p. 164, <i>note</i>).</p>

<p>It is possible that the R. W. of another of Vaughan's Elegies
may also have been a Walbeoffe. <i>Cf.</i> p. 79, <i>note</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Grosart was unable to identify the initials C. W. The Walbeoffes, or
Walbieffes, of Llanhamlach, the next village to Llansantfread, were
among the most important of the <i>Advenae</i>, or Norman settlers of
Brecknockshire. They were related, as the following table shows, to the
Vaughans of Tretower. The following extract from the genealogy of the
Walbeoffes of Llanhamlach is compiled from Harl. MS. 2,289. f. 136<i>b</i>;
Jones, <i>History of Brecknockshire</i>, ii., 484; Miss G. E. F. Morgan, in
<i>Brecon County Times</i> for May 13, 1887.

<h4>P. <a href="#Page_193">193</a>. In Zodiacum Marcelli Palingenii.</h4>

<p>Marcellus Palingenius, or Petro Angelo Manzoli, wrote his
didactic and satirical poem, the <i>Zodiacus Vitae</i>, about 1535.
It was translated into English by Barnabee Googe in 1560-1565.
The latest edition of the original is that by C. C. Weise
(1832). As we may gather from Vaughan's lines, Manzoli was
an earnest student of occult lore. <i>Cf.</i> Gustave Reynier, <i>De
Marcelli Palingenii Stellatae Poctae Zodiaco Vitae</i> (1893).</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_195">195</a>. To Lysimachus.</h4>

<p><i>Bevis ... Arundel ... Morglay</i>. The allusion is to
the <i>Romance of Sir Bevis of Hampton</i> (ed. E. K&ouml;lbing,

<h4>P. <a href="#Page_197">197</a>. On Sir Thomas Bodley's Library.</h4>

<p>If Vaughan was not himself an Oxford man (<i>Biog. Note</i>,

Llandetty, was a kinsman of Vaughan's, as the following table

6th July, 1586. He was made one of the Barons of the
Exchequer 12th May, 1625; and was one of the six judges who
refused to accept the new commission offered them by the
ruling powers under the Commonwealth. He died 21st
December, 1656, and is buried at Lemington-Hastang, in
Warwickshire." (Dr. Grosart.)</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_214">214</a>. To Etesia (for Timander) The First Sight.</h4>

<p>I do not think we need look for anything autobiographical in
this and the following poems written to Etesia. They are
written "for Timander," that is, either to serve the suit of a
friend, or as copies of verses with no personal reference at all.
The names Etesia and Timander smack of Orinda's poetic circle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_224">224</a>. Translations from Severinus.</h4>

<p>Dr. Grosart hunted out an obscure Neapolitan, Marcus
Aurelius Severino, and ascribed to him the originals of these
translations. They are of course from the <i>De Consolatione
Philosophiae</i> of Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius, and are a
continuation of the pieces already printed in <i>Olor Iscanus</i>
(pp. 125-143).</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_245">245</a>. Pious Thoughts and Ejaculations.</h4>

<p>These are much in the vein of <i>Silex Scintillans</i>. They
probably belong to various dates later than 1655, when the
second part of that collection appeared. <i>The Nativity</i>
(p. 259) is dated 1656, and <i>The True Christmas</i> (p. 261) was
apparently written after the Restoration.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_261">261</a>. The True Christmas.</h4>

<p>Vaughan was no Puritan; <i>cf.</i> his lines on <i>Christ's Nativity</i>
(vol. i., p. 107)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Alas, my God! Thy birth now here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must not be numbered in the year,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but he was not much in sympathy with the ideals of the Restoration either;
<i>cf.</i> the passage on "our unjust ways" in <i>Daphnis</i> (p. 284).</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_267">267</a>. De Salmone.</h4>

<p>On Thomas Powell, <i>cf.</i> p. 57, note.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_272">272</a>. The Bee.</h4>

<p><i>Hilarion's servant, the sage crow.</i> There seems to be some
confusion between Hilarion, an obscure fourth-century Abbot,
and Paul the Hermit, of whom it is related in his <i>Life by
S. Jerome</i> that for sixty years he was daily provided with half
a loaf of bread by a crow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_278">278</a>. Daphnis.</h4>

<p>The subject of the Eclogue appears to be Vaughan's brother
Thomas, who died 27th February, 1666. On him <i>see</i> the
<i>Biographical Note</i> (vol. ii., p. xxxiii).</p>

<p><i>true black Moors</i>; an allusion, perhaps, to Thomas
Vaughan's controversy with Henry More.</p>

<p><i>Old Amphion</i>; perhaps Matthew Herbert, on whom see note to p. 158.</p>

<p><i>The Isis and the prouder Thames.</i> Thomas Vaughan was
buried at Albury, near Oxford.</p>

<p><i>Noble Murray.</i> Thomas Vaughan's patron, himself a poet
and alchemist, Sir Robert Murray, Secretary of State for
Scotland. His poems have been collected by the Hunterian Club.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>


<h3>FRAGMENTS AND TRANSLATIONS.</h3>


<p>The larger number of the verses in this section are translated
quotations scattered through Vaughan's prose-pamphlets.
Dr. Grosart identified some of the originals; I have added a
few others; but the larger number remain obscure and are
hardly worth spending much labour upon. The title-pages of
the pamphlets will be found in the <i>Bibliography</i> (vol. ii., p. lvii).</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_289">289</a>. From Eucharistica Oxoniensia.</h4>

<p>I have already, in the <i>Biographical Note</i> (vol. ii., p. xxviii),
given reasons for doubting whether this poem is by the Silurist.
It was first printed as his by Dr. Grosart. Charles the First was
in Scotland, trying to settle his differences with the Scots,
during the closing months of 1641.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_291">291</a>. Translations from Plutarch and Maximus Tyrius.</h4>

<p>These, together with a translation of Guevara's <i>De vitae
rusticae laudibus</i>, were appended to the <i>Olor Iscanus</i>. Vaughan
did not translate directly from the Greek, but from a Latin
version published in 1613-14 amongst some tracts by John
Reynolds, Lecturer in Greek at, and afterwards President of
Corpus Christi College, Oxford.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_294">294</a>. From the Mount of Olives.</h4>

<p>A volume of Devotions published by Vaughan in 1652. The
preface, dated 1st October, 1651, is addressed to Sir Charles
Egerton, Knight, and in it Vaughan speaks of "that near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
relation by which my dearest friend lays claim to your person."
It is impossible to say who is the "dearest friend" referred to.
The <i>Flores Solitudinis</i> (1654) is also dedicated to Sir Charles
Egerton. He was probably of Staffordshire. Dr. Grosart
(II. xxxiii) states that in Hanbury Church, co. Stafford, is a
monument <i>Caroli Egertoni Equitis Aurati</i>, who died 1662.
Perhaps therefore he was connected with Vaughan's wife's
family, the Wises of Staffordshire.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_298">298</a>. From Man in Glory.</h4>

<p>This translation from a work attributed to St. Anselm and
published as his in 1639 is appended to the Mount of Olives.</p>

<p>In the original lines 5, 6, are printed in error after lines 7, 8.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_299">299</a>. From Flores Solitudinis.</h4>

<p>In 1654 Vaughan published a volume containing (1) translations
of two discourses by Eusebius Nierembergius, (2) a
translation of Eucherius, <i>De Contemptu Mundi</i>, (3) an original
life of S. Paulinus, Bishop of Nola. These were poems
"collected in his sickness and retirement." The Epistle-dedicatory
to Sir Charles Egerton is dated 1653, and that to
the reader which precedes the translations from Nierembergius
on 17th April, 1652.</p>

<p><i>Bissellius.</i> John Bissel a Jesuit, (1601-1677), wrote <i>Deliciae
Aetatis</i>, <i>Argonauticon Americanorum</i>, etc. (Grosart).</p>

<p><i>Augurellius.</i> Johannes Aurelius Augurellius of Rimini
(1454-1537), wrote <i>Carmina</i>, <i>Chrysopoeia</i>, <i>Geronticon</i>, etc.
(Grosart).</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_307">307</a>. From Primitive Holiness.</h4>

<p>This original life of S. Paulinus of Nola, by far the most
striking of Vaughan's prose works, contains a number of poems,
pieced together by Vaughan from lines in Paulinus' own poems
and in those of Ausonius addressed to him. The edition used
by Vaughan seems to have been that published by Rosweyd at
Antwerp in 1622. I have traced the sources of the poems so far
as I can in the edition published by W. de Hartel in the <i>Corpus</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
<i>Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum</i> (vols. xxix, xxx 1894).</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_322">322</a>. From Hermetical Physic.</h4>

<p>A translation from the <i>Naturae Sanctuarium! quod est
Physica Hermetica</i> (1619) of the alchemist Henry Nollius,
published by Vaughan in 1655.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_323">323</a>. From Cerbyd Fechydwiaeth.</h4>

<p>This tract is bound up with the Brit. Mus. copy of [Thomas
Powell's] <i>Quadriga Salutis</i> (1657), of which it appears to be a
Welsh translation. The verses, to which nothing corresponds
in the English version, are signed Ol[or] Vaughan (<i>cf.</i> Olor
Iscanus). Professor Palgrave (<i>Y Cymrodor</i>, 1890-1) translates
them as follows: "The Lord's Prayer, when looked into (we
see), the Trinity of His Fatherly goodness has given it as a
foundation-stone of all prayer, and has made it for our
instruction in doctrine." He adds that this Englyn occurs with
others written in an eighteenth-century hand on the fly-leaf of
a MS. of Welsh poetry by Iago ab Duwi.</p>


<h4>P. <a href="#Page_324">324</a>. From Humane Industry.</h4>

<p>On Thomas Powell <i>cf.</i> p. 57, note. The first three of
these translations are marked H. V. in the margin; of the
fourth Powell says, "The translation of Mr. Hen. Vaughan,
Silurist, whose excellent Poems are published." Many other
translations are scattered through the book, but there is
nothing to connect them with Vaughan.
